<p>I have often asked myself whether it would not be possible to
give in a small compass, and avoiding all technical detail, such
an account of the diseases of infancy and childhood, as might
be of use and comfort to the intelligent mother.</p>

<p>Returning now, with health perfectly restored, to practise my
profession for the rest of my life exclusively in my own country,
I have brought with me this little book, in which the comparative
leisure of my enforced sojourn at Nice has enabled me
to realise my purpose.</p>

<p>The book is not intended as a handbook for the nursery;
many such exist, and many of them are of great merit.
Neither has it the worse than idle pretence of telling people
how to treat their children's illnesses, without the help of a
doctor. Its object is to give a description of the diseases of
early life, such as may help a mother to understand something
of their nature and symptoms, to save her from needless anxiety
as to their issue, and to enable her wisely to second the doctor
in his endeavours for their cure.</p>

<h3>ON THE MORTALITY OF CHILDREN, AND ITS CAUSES.</h3>


<p>The purpose of this little book will probably be best attained,
and needless repetition best avoided, if we begin by inquiring
very briefly why so many children die, what general signs
indicate that they are ill, and what general rules can be laid
down for their management in sickness.</p>

<p>The first of these inquiries would be as useless as it would
be sad, if the rate of infant mortality were fixed by determinate
laws, such as those which limit the stature of man or the age
to which he can attain.</p>

<p>But this is not so; the mortality in early life varies widely
in different countries, in different parts of the same country,
and in the same country at different times. Thus, while in
some parts of Germany the mortality under one year was
recently as high as 25 to 30 per cent. of the total births, and in
England as 15, it was only a little above 10 per cent. in
Norway. Infantile mortality is higher in manufacturing districts,
lower in those which are agricultural, and varies from
16 per cent. in Lancashire to 9 in Dorsetshire. It is then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>evident that mortality in infancy is in part dependent on
remediable causes; and of this there is no better proof than
the fact that the mortality in England under one year has been
reduced from 15 per cent. in 1872 to 13 per cent. in 1882.</p>

<p>It would lead us far from any practical purpose if we were
to examine into all the causes which govern the liability to
disease and death during infancy and childhood, in the different
ranks of society. We must therefore limit our inquiry to those
conditions which are met with in the class to which my readers
may fairly be assumed to belong.</p>

<p><i>First</i> among the causes of sickly infancy and premature
death may be mentioned the intermarriage of near relatives.
The experience of the breeders of animals, who, by what is
termed breeding in and in, undoubtedly obtain certain qualities
of speed, or strength, or beauty, does not apply here. They
select for their experiments animals whose qualities in these
respects are pre-eminent, and eliminate from them all who do
not occupy the first rank. In family intermarriages, however,
it is rare that any consideration is regarded, save that of wealth;
and the fact remains, explain it as we may, that the intermarriage
of near relatives during several successive generations
is followed by a marked deterioration of the children, physical,
mental, and moral; and by the intensifying of any hereditary
predisposition to consumption, scrofula, and other constitutional
ailments which form the <i>second</i> great cause of early sickness
and mortality.</p>

<p>These are facts known to all, which yet it is not easy to
represent by figures. All the world is aware that consumption
is hereditary, that consumptive parents are more likely than
others to have consumptive children; and a fourth of all the
patients admitted into the Hospital for Consumption at
Brompton stated that the disease had existed in one or other
of their parents.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Scrofula, which is another disease closely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>allied to consumption, is hereditary also; and hip disease,
disease of the spine, abscesses, and enlarged glands in any
members of a family, point to risks for the offspring which
should not be forgotten, how much soever mental endowments,
personal beauty, or the charms of disposition may be
considered, and sometimes reasonably enough, to outweigh
them. The same liability exists with reference to epilepsy, insanity,
and the whole class of affections of the nervous system.
Parents inquire, with no misplaced solicitude, what is her
fortune, or what are the pecuniary resources of him to whom
they are asked to entrust their son's or daughter's future.
Believe me, the question&mdash;what is the health of his family, or
of hers? is consumption hereditary, or scrofula, or epilepsy, or
insanity?&mdash;is of far greater moment, and touches much more
nearly the future happiness of those we love.</p>

<p>These two points regard the future parents themselves;
but there are other conditions on which the health of children
to a great degree depends; and of these the two most important
are the <i>dwelling</i> they inhabit, and the <i>food</i> they eat.</p>

<p>I do not refer here to the dwellings of the poor, situated in
unhealthy localities, where fresh air does not enter, where the
rays of the sun do not penetrate, with defective drainage and
imperfect water-supply; but I speak of the nurseries of well-to-do
people. 'This will do for our bedroom, and that will
make a nice spare room, and that will do for the children,' is
what one often hears. Had you rare plants which cost much
money to obtain, which needed sunlight, warmth, and air,
would you not consider anxiously the position of your conservatory,
and take much pains to insure that nothing should
be wanting that could help their development, so that you
might feast your eyes upon their beauty, or delight yourselves
with their fragrance? And yet a room at the top of the
house, one of the attics perhaps, is too often destined for the
little one and its nurse; or if there are two or three children,
one small room is set apart for the day nursery, and a second,
probably with a different aspect, for a sleeping room, and so
small that it does not furnish the needed five hundred cubic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>feet of air for each. And as a consequence, the children are
ailing, any predisposition in them to hereditary disease is
fostered, they have no strength to battle against any acute
illness that may befall them, and yet surprise is felt that the
doctor is never out of the house.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It is needless to dwell on the hand-feeding of infants as one
of the great causes of mortality in infancy, and of sickliness
in later life. The statistics of Foundling Hospitals bear sad
testimony to the fact of its dangers, and the researches of
physicians show that a peculiar form of disease is produced by
it, attended by symptoms, and giving rise to appearances after
death, peculiar to the form of slow starvation from which the
infant has perished. I will add, because it is not generally
known, one fresh illustration of the influence of artificial feeding
in aggravating the mortality of infants. In Berlin the certificates
of death of all infants under the age of one year, are required
to state whether the little one had been brought up at
the breast, or on some kind or other of artificial food. Of ten
thousand children dying under the age of one year, one-fourth
had been brought up at the breast, three-fourths by hand.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is, as I said in the preface, no part of my plan to enter
on any details with reference to the management of children
in health. It may, therefore, suffice to have pointed out the
four great causes of preventible disease among the wealthier
classes of society; namely, the intermarriage of near relatives,
the transmission of constitutional taint, the insanitary condition
of the dwelling, and the injudicious selection of the food of the
infant.</p>

<h3>THE GENERAL SIGNS OF DISEASE IN INFANCY AND
CHILDHOOD.</h3>


<p>The signs of disease at all ages may be referred to one or
other of three great classes: disorder of function, alteration of
temperature, complaint of pain.</p>

<p>In the infant it is the last of these which very often calls
attention to the illness from which it is suffering. Cries are the
only language which a young baby has to express its distress;
as smiles and laughter and merry antics tell without a word its
gladness. The baby must be ill, is all that its cries tell one
person; another, who has seen much of sick children, will
gather from them more, and will be able to judge whether its
suffering is in the head, or chest, or stomach. The cries of a
baby with stomach-ache are long and loud and passionate; it
sheds a profusion of tears; now stops for a moment, and
then begins again, drawing up its legs to its stomach; and as
the pain passes off, stretches them out again, and with many
little sobs passes off into a quiet sleep. If it has inflammation
of the chest it does not cry aloud, it sheds no tears, but every
few minutes, especially after drawing a deeper breath than
before, or after each short hacking cough, it gives a little cry,
which it checks apparently before it is half finished; and this,
either because it has no breath to waste in cries, or because the
effort makes its breathing more painful. If disease is going
on in the head, the child utters sharp piercing shrieks, and
then between whiles a low moan or wail, or perhaps no sound
at all, but lies quiet, apparently dozing, till pain wakes it up
again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>It is not, however, by the cry alone, or by any one sign of
disease, that it is possible to judge either of its nature or of its
degree, but the mention of this serves merely as an illustration,
which anyone can understand, of the different meanings that
even a baby's cry will convey to different persons.</p>

<p>When a child is taken ill, be the disease from which it is
about to suffer what it may, there is at once a change from its
condition when in health, such as soon attracts the attention
even of the least observant. The child loses its appetite, is
fretful and soon tired, and either very sleepy or very restless,
while most likely it is thirsty, and its skin hotter than natural.
In many instances, too, it feels sick or actually vomits, while its
bowels are either much purged or very bound. If old enough to
talk, it generally complains of feeling ill, or says that it has pain
in some part or other, though it is by no means certain that a
little child has described rightly the seat of its pain; for it very
often says that its head aches or that its stomach aches, just
because it has heard people when ill complain of pain in the head
or in the stomach. Some of these signs of illness are, of course,
absent in the infant, who can describe its feelings even by signs
imperfectly; but the baby loses its merry laugh and its cheerful
look; it ceases to watch its mother's or its nurse's eye as it
was used to do, though it clings to her more closely than ever,
and will not be out of her arms even for a moment; and if at
length rocked to sleep in her lap, will yet wake up and cry
immediately on being placed in its cot again.</p>

<p>Symptoms such as these are sure to awaken the mother's
attention to her child, and the child's welfare and the parent's
happiness alike depend, in many instances, on the way in which
she sets about to answer the question, 'What is the matter?'</p>

<p>Some mothers send at once to the doctor whenever they
see or fancy that anything ails their child. But this way of
getting rid of responsibility is not always possible, nor, indeed,
on moral grounds, is it always desirable, for the mother who
delegates each unpleasant duty to another, whether nurse,
governess, or doctor, in order to save herself trouble or anxiety,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>performs but half a mother's part, and can expect but half a
mother's recompense of love.</p>

<p>Whenever a child is unwell, a mother may do much to
ascertain what is the matter, and may by the exercise of a little
patience and common sense save herself much needless heart-ache,
and her child much suffering.</p>

<p>The first point to ascertain is the presence or absence of
fever; that is to say, whether, and how much, the temperature
of the body is higher than natural. If the temperature is not
higher than natural, it may be taken as almost certain that the
child neither has any inflammatory affection of the chest, nor is
about to suffer from any of the eruptive fevers. The temperature,
however, cannot be judged of merely by the sensation
conveyed to the hand, but must be ascertained by means of the
thermometer.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the case of the grown person the thermometer
is placed either under the tongue, the lips being closed
over it, or in the armpit, and is kept there five or six minutes.
In young children, however, neither of these is practicable, and
I prefer to place the instrument in the groin, and crossing one
leg over the other, to maintain the thermometer there for the
requisite five minutes. The temperature of the body in health
is about 98.5&deg; Fahr. in the grown person, and very slightly
higher in childhood; but any heat above 99.5&deg; may be regarded
as evidence that something is wrong, and the persistence
for more than twenty-four hours of a temperature of 101&deg; and
upwards, may be taken as almost conclusive proof of the
existence of some serious inflammation, or of the onset of one
of the eruptive fevers.</p>

<p>At the same time it is well to bear in mind that temporary
causes, such as especially the disorders produced by over-fatigue,
or by an over-hearty or indigestible meal, may suddenly
raise the temperature as high as 102&deg;, or higher, but the
needed repose or the action of a purgative may be followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>in a few hours by an almost equally sudden decline of the heat
to the natural standard.</p>

<p>It is well to learn to count the pulse and the frequency of
the breathing; but to do the former accurately, requires
practice such as is hardly gained except by hospital training;
and indeed, with few exceptions, the value of the information
furnished by the pulse is less in the child than in the adult.
The reasons for this are obvious, since the rapidity of the
circulation varies under the slightest causes, and the very constraint
of holding the sick child's hand makes it struggle, and
its efforts raise the frequency of the heart-beats by ten or
twenty in the minute. The place at which to seek the beat
of the pulse is at the wrist, just inside and below the protuberance
of the wrist-bone; but if the child is very fat it is
often difficult to detect it. When detected it is not easy to
count it in early infancy, for during the first year of life the
heart beats between 120 and 130 in the minute, diminishing
between that age and five years to 100, and gradually sinking
to 90 at twelve years old. In proportion, moreover, to the
tender age of the child, is the rapidity of its circulation apt to
vary under the influence of slight causes, while both its frequency
and that of the breathing are about a third less during
sleep than in the waking state.</p>

<p>The frequency of the breathing is less difficult to ascertain,
while at the same time it furnishes more reliable information
than the pulse. This is best tested when the child is asleep,
remembering always that the breathing is then slower than in
the waking state. The open hand, well warmed, should be
laid flat and gently over the child's night-dress on the lower
part of the chest and the pit of the stomach. Each heaving of
the chest, which marks a fresh breath being taken, may be
counted, and the information thus obtained is very valuable.
Up to the age of two years the child breathes from 30 to 40
times in a minute, and this frequency gradually declines to from
25 to 30 till the age of twelve, and then settles down to from
20 to 25 as in the grown person. You would thus know that
a sleeping infant who was breathing more than 30 times, or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>child of five who breathes more than 25 times, has some ailment
in its chest, and that the doctor should be sent for in
order to ascertain its exact nature.</p>

<p>It would answer no good purpose to give a description of
the information to be obtained by listening to the chest. To
learn from this, needs the well-trained ear; and harm, not
good, comes from the half-knowledge which serves but to lead
astray.</p>

<p>A child may be very suffering, seem very ill, and its suffering
and illness may depend on pain in the stomach owing to
indigestion, constipation, or even to an accidental chill. After
early infancy it is not difficult to make out the seat of the
child's suffering: the warm hand placed gently on its stomach
will soon ascertain whether it is tense or tender, whether the
tenderness is confined to one particular spot, or whether it
is more acute at one spot than at another; and, lastly,
whether, as is the case when pain is produced by wind in the
intestines, the pain and tenderness are both relieved by gentle
rubbing.</p>

<p>In the young infant the character of the cry will, as I have
already said, give some clue to the seat of its pain, while, if
you lay it down in its cot or in its nurse's arms in order to
examine its stomach, it will often resist and begin to cry. Its
stomach then becomes perfectly tense, and you cannot tell
whether pressure on it causes pain or whether the cries are
not altogether the consequence of fretfulness and fear. It is
therefore the best plan to pass your hand beneath the child's
clothes and to examine its stomach without altering its posture,
while at the same time the nurse in whose arms it is talks to it
to distract its attention, or holds it opposite the window, or
opposite a bright light, which seldom fails to amuse an infant.
If there is no tenderness of the stomach the child will not cry
on pressure; or if during your examination the presence of
wind in the intestines should occasion pain, gentle friction,
instead of increasing suffering, will give relief.</p>

<p>The one thing which still remains to do, especially in the
case of children in whom teething is not over, is to examine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>the mouth and ascertain the state of the gums, since some
ailments are caused and others are aggravated by teething.
A wise mother or an intelligent nurse will teach the child when
well the little trick of putting out its tongue and opening its
mouth to show its teeth when told to do so; and though it
may sometimes indulge rather out of place in these performances
when wished to behave especially prettily before
strangers, yet when older it will quickly learn the proprieties
of behaviour, and in the meanwhile you profit much by the
lesson when illness really comes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, infants who when well will open their
mouth and allow their gums to be felt without difficulty, refuse
to do so when ill; and it is always desirable that the mother
or nurse whose duty it is to tend the sick child constantly,
should not frighten it, or lose its confidence, by doing forcibly
that which the doctor who comes occasionally may yet be
quite right in doing. You will, however, generally get a good
view of the mouth and throat in young infants by gently
touching the lips with your finger: the child opens its mouth
instinctively, and then you can run your finger quickly over its
tongue, and drawing it slightly forward perfectly see the condition
of the throat, feel the gums as you withdraw your finger,
and notice the appearance of the tongue. Sometimes it is
important to ascertain whether a tooth which was near coming
through has actually pierced the gum, and yet the child's
fretfulness renders it almost impossible to induce it to open
its mouth. If now, while the nurse holds the child in her
arms, you go behind her, you can, unseen and unawares,
introduce your finger into its mouth and ascertain all you wish
to know before the little one has recovered from its surprise.</p>

<p>I have but little to say here about the general signs of
brain disease in infancy and childhood, because they will need
minute notice afterwards. All that I would at present observe
is, that you must not at once conclude that a child's head is
seriously affected, because it is heavy and fretful and passionate,
and refuses to be amused. The head, as we know by our own
experience, suffers by sympathy in the course of almost every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ailment, certainly of every acute ailment, at all ages. If the
babe is not sick; if its bowels can be acted on by ordinary
means; if, though drowsy, it can be roused without difficulty;
if, though it may prefer a darkened room, it does not shrink
from the light when admitted gradually; if it has no slight
twitchings of its fingers or of its wrists; if the head, though hot,
is not hotter than the rest of the body; if the large vessels of
the neck, or the open part of the head, or fontanelle as it is
termed, in an infant in whom the head is not yet closed, are
not beating violently; and, above all, <i>if when it cries it sheds
tears</i>, you may quiet your mind on the score of the child's
brain, at any rate until the doctor's visit, and may turn a deaf
ear to the nurse or the friend who assures you that the child
is about to have convulsions or to be attacked by inflammation
of the brain.</p>

<h3>THE GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF DISEASE IN INFANCY
AND CHILDHOOD.</h3>


<p>The management of the child when ill is difficult or easy in
exact proportion to whether it has been ill or well managed
when in health. The mother who lives but little with her
children, who contents herself with a daily visit to the nursery,
and who then scarcely sees her little ones until they are brought
into the drawing-room in the evening in full dress, to be petted
and admired and fondled by the visitors, cannot expect to take
her place by the child's bed in its sickness, to soothe its pain,
and to expend upon it all the pent-up tenderness which, in
spite of the calls of business or of pleasure, still dwells within
her heart. She must be content to see the infant turn from
her to the nurse with whose face it has all its life been
familiar; or to hear the little one tell her to go away, for her
presence is associated with none of those 'familiar acts, made
beautiful by love,' which win the young heart: the mother is
but a stranger who brings no help, who relieves no distress.
Happy such a mother if she has found a conscientious and intelligent
nurse to whom she can delegate her office; but she
must remember that with the child, love follows in the steps of
daily, hourly kindnesses, that a mother's part must be played
in health if it is to be undertaken in sickness, that it cannot
be laid down and taken up again at pleasure.</p>

<p>There is another mother who cannot nurse her child to
any good purpose, she who when it was well spoilt it from
excess of love, who has yielded to each wayward wish, and has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>allowed it to become the petty tyrant of the household. The
child is ill, it is languid, feverish, and in pain; no position is
quite easy to it, no food pleasant to it, bed is irksome, medicine
is nasty. It knows only that it suffers, it has been accustomed
to have its will obeyed in everything, and cannot understand
that its suffering is not at once taken away. It insists on
getting up and on being dressed, or on lying in its mother's or
nurse's lap, where the warmth of another person's body does
but aggravate its fever; it screams with passion at the approach
of the doctor, it will not allow itself to be examined, it will
take no medicine; the doctor is powerless, the mother heart-broken.
Sickness is not the time to exercise authority which
has not been put in force before; and, not once but many
times, I have watched, a sad spectator, the death of children
from an illness not necessarily fatal, but rendered so because it
was impossible to learn the progress of disease, impossible to
administer the necessary remedies.</p>


<p class="center"><i>What a child has been made when well, such it will be
when sick.</i></p>

<p>One more point I must insist on before going into details,
and that is as to the necessity of perfect truthfulness in dealing
with sick children. The foolish device of telling a child when
ill, that the doctor who has been sent for is its uncle or its
cousin, is the outcome of the still more foolish falsehood of
threatening the child with the doctor's visit if it does not do
this or that. No endeavour should be spared by nurse or
parent, or by the doctor himself, to render his visit popular in
the nursery. Three-fourths of the difficulties which attend the
administration of medicine are commonly the result of previous
bad management of the child, of foolish over-indulgence, or of
still more foolish want of truthfulness. It may answer once to
tell a child that medicine is nice when really it is nasty, but
the trick will scarcely succeed a second time, and the one
success will increase your difficulties ever after. If medicine is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>absolutely necessary, and the child is too young to understand
reason, it must be given by force, very firmly but very kindly,
and the grief it occasions will be forgotten in an hour or two.
If he is old enough, tell him that the medicine is ordered to do
him good, and firmness combined with gentleness will usually
succeed in inducing him to take it. The advantage of perfect
truthfulness extends to every incident in the illness of children,
even to the not saying, 'Oh, you will soon be well,' if it is not
likely so to be. If children find you never deceive them, how
implicitly they will <i>trust</i> you, what an infinity of trouble is
saved, and how much rest of mind is secured to the poor little
sufferer!</p>

<p>A little boy three years old was ordered to be cupped. The
cupper, a kind old man, said to encourage him, 'Oh, dear little
boy, it's nothing.' The child turned to his mother, saying,
'Mummy, is that true?' His mother said it was not, but that
for her sake she hoped he would try to bear it well. And the
operation was performed without a cry or a sound.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the moral conditions implied in the
successful management of sick children. There are certain
physical conditions no less important. The sick child should
not be left in the common nursery, of which he would taint the
air, while he would be disturbed by its other little inmates.
He must (and of course I am speaking not of some slight
ailment, but of a more serious indisposition) be in a room
by himself, which should be kept quiet and shaded, and
at a temperature which should not be allowed to fall below
60&deg; if the chest is in any way affected, nor to exceed 55&deg; in
other cases, and this temperature should always be measured,
not by guess, but by the thermometer hung close to the
child's bed. The room is to be shaded, not by curtains
round the bed&mdash;for, save in special circumstances, curtains
should be banished from the nursery&mdash;nor by closed shutters
which exclude both light and air, but by letting down the
blinds, so as to have a sort of twilight in the room, and by
shading any light which at night may be burned in the apartment;
while whether by day or night the child should be so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>placed that his face shall be turned from the light, not directed
towards it. The room should be kept quiet, and this requires
not only general quiet in the house, but quiet in the movements
of all persons in the room; speaking, not in a whisper, but in
a low and gentle voice; walking carefully, not in a silk dress
nor in creaky shoes, but not on tiptoe, for there is a fussy sham
quietness which disturbs the sick far more than the loudest
noise.</p>

<p>Little precautions, so trifling that few think of noticing
them, have much to do with the quiet of the sick-room, and
consequently with the patient's comfort. A rattling window
will keep a child awake for hours, or the creaking handle of the
door rouse it up again each time anyone enters the room; and
to put a wedge in the window, or to tie back the handle, and
so quietly open and close the door, may do more than medicine
towards promoting the child's recovery. There can, however,
be no abiding quiet without a well-ordered room, and the old
proverb carried out, 'A place for everything, and everything in
its place.' A table covered with a cloth so that things may
be taken up and put down noiselessly, and set apart for the
medicine, the drink, the nourishment, cups, glasses, spoons, or
whatever else the patient is in frequent need of; with a <i>wooden</i>
bowl and water for rinsing cups and glasses in, and a cloth or
two for wiping them, will save much trouble and noise, and the
loud whispers of the attendants to each other, 'Where is the
sugar? where is the arrowroot? where did you put down the
medicine?' of which we hear so much in the sick-room, so
much especially in the sick-room of the child, who is unable to
tell how extremely all this disturbs him.</p>

<p>One more caution still remains for me to give. Do not
talk to the doctor in the child's room, do not relate bad
symptoms, do not express your fears, nor ask the doctor his
opinion in the child's hearing. The child often understands
much more than you would imagine, misunderstands still more;
and over and over again I have known the thoughtless utterance
of the mother, nurse, or doctor depress a child's spirits
and seriously retard his recovery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>It is consoling to bear in mind that how grave soever a
child's illness may be, the power of repair is greater in early
life than in adult age, that with few exceptions the probability
of recovery is greater in the child than it would be from the
same disease in the grown person. This too is due not simply
to the activity of the reparative powers in early life, but also in
great measure to the mental and moral characteristics of childhood.</p>

<p>To make the sick child happy, in order that he may get
well, is the unwritten lesson which they who have best learnt,
know best how to nurse sick children. It may seem strange,
that from so high a purpose I should at once come down to
so commonplace a detail as to insist on the importance, even
on this account, of keeping the sick child in bed.</p>

<p>At the onset of every illness of which the nature is not
obvious, during the course of any illness in which the chest
is affected, or in which the temperature is higher than natural,
bed is the best and happiest place for the child. In it repose
is most complete, far more complete than after early babyhood
it can be in the nurse's or mother's lap, and free from the great
objection of the increased heat from being in contact with
another person's body. Nothing is more painful than to
witness the little child, sick and feverish, with heavy eyes, and
aching head, up and dressed, trying to amuse itself with its
customary toys; then, with 'Please nurse me,' begging to be
taken in the lap, then getting down again; fretful, and sad,
and passionate by turns; dragging about its misery, wearing
out its little strength, in deference to the prejudice that bed is
so weakening.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The bed does not weaken, but the disease does which renders
bed necessary.</i></p>

<p>A child frets sometimes at the commencement of an illness
if kept in its own little cot. But put it in its nurse's or
mother's big bed, set a tea tray with some new toys upon it
before the child, and a pillow behind it, so that when tired with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>play it may lie back and go to sleep, and you will have husbanded
its strength and saved your own, have halved your
anxiety and doubled the child's happiness.</p>

<p>Young infants, indeed, when ill often refuse to be put out
of the arms, but over and over again I have found the experiment
succeed of laying the baby on a bed, the nurse or mother
lying down by its side, and soothing it to sleep. Were there
no other drawback, it is a waste of power to have two persons
employed in nursing a sick child; one to keep it in her lap,
and the other to wait upon her.</p>

<p>It is important in all serious illnesses of children, as well as
of a grown person, that the bed should be so placed that the
attendant can pass on either side, and can from either side
reach the patient to do whatever is necessary. Most cots for
young children have a rail round them to prevent the child
falling out of bed when asleep or at play; but nothing can be
more inconvenient than the fixed rail over which the attendant
has to bend in order to give the child food or medicine, or for
any other purpose. When I founded the Children's Hospital
in Ormond Street, I introduced children's cots (the idea of
which I took from those in the Children's Hospital at Frankfort)
the sides of which let down when needed, while on the
top of the rail, or dependent from it, a board is placed surrounded
by a raised beading on which the toys, the food, or
drink may be put with great convenience. These bedsteads,
with probably some improved arrangement for letting down the
sides, may be seen now in most children's hospitals, but I have
been surprised to observe how seldom they are employed in
private nurseries, and how comparatively few bedstead-makers
are acquainted with them. The result would probably have
been very different had a patent been taken out for them, and
had they been largely advertised as 'Dr. West's improved
children's bedsteads'! The uninclosed spring mattress, and
the wedge-shaped horsehair cushion, both of which I introduced
in Ormond Street, are also very valuable. The latter slightly
raises the head and shoulders, and renders any other than a
thin horsehair pillow for the head to rest on unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>A few more hints about the bed may not be out of place.
First of all, after early infancy is over, at latest after nine
months, except for some very special reason the napkin should
be done away with. It heats the child, chafes it, and makes it
sore; it conceals the inattention of the nurse, and at the same
time renders it less easy to keep the little one absolutely clean
than if a folded napkin is placed under the hips, whence it can
be at once removed when soiled. In all serious illness a
piece of macintosh should be placed under the sheet, as is
done in the lying-in room, and a draw-sheet, as it is termed,
over it. The draw-sheet is, as its name implies, a folded sheet,
laid under the hips, and withdrawn in part when needed so as
to prevent the child ever lying on linen that is wet or soiled.
It can be drawn away from under the child, and a portion still
clean and dry brought under it, while the soiled part is rolled
together and wrapped up in macintosh at one side of the bed
until a new draw sheet is substituted, which is easily done by
tacking a fresh sheet to that which is about to be withdrawn,
when the fresh one is brought under the child's body as that
which is soiled is removed. The greatest care should always
be taken that the under sheet is perfectly free from ruck or
wrinkle; in long illnesses the skin becomes chafed and bed-sores
may be produced by neglect of this simple precaution.
The complaint that a child throws off the bed-clothes is easily
remedied by a couple of bits of tape tied on either side loosely
from the sheet or blanket to the sides of the cot.</p>

<p>When children are compelled to remain long in bed, great
care is needed to prevent the skin from being chafed, which is
the first step that leads to the occurrence of bed-sores. Careful
washing with soap and water daily of the whole body, not only
of those parts which may be soiled by the urine or the evacuations;
the washing afterwards with pure tepid water; careful
drying, and abundant powdering with starch powder, will do
much to prevent the accident. If, in spite of this care, the
skin seems anywhere to be red or chafed, it should be sponged
over with brandy or with sweet spirits of nitre before powdering.
Real bed-sores must be seen and treated by the doctor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>The warm bath is a great source of comfort to the sick
child, and in all cases of feverishness, of influenza, or threatening
bronchitis, it should not be omitted before the child is put
to bed, or must be given towards evening if the child has not
been up during the day. The bath may be either warm or hot,
the temperature of the former being 90&deg; to 92&deg;, that of the latter
95&deg; to 96&deg;. The temperature should always be ascertained by
the thermometer, and the <i>warm</i> bath only should be employed,
except when the <i>hot</i> bath is ordered by the doctor. The warm
bath relieves feverishness and quiets the system, and promotes
gentle perspiration; the hot bath is given when the eruption
of scarlet fever or of measles fails to come out properly, or in
some cases of convulsions at the same time that cold is applied
to the head, or, in some forms of dropsy when it is of importance
to excite the action of the skin as much as possible. It
is not desirable that a child should remain less than five or
more than ten minutes in the bath, and attention must be paid
by the addition of warm water to maintain the bath at the same
temperature during the whole time of the child's immersion.</p>

<p>Now and then infants and very young children when ill
seem frightened at the bath, and then instead of being soothed
and relieved by it they are only excited and distressed. If the
bath is brought into the room, prepared in the child's sight,
and he is then taken out of bed, undressed, and put into the
water which he sees steaming before him, he very often becomes
greatly alarmed, struggles violently, cries passionately, and
does not become quiet again till he has sobbed himself to
sleep. All this time, however, he has been exerting his inflamed
lungs to the utmost, and will probably have thereby
done himself ten times more harm than the bath has done
good. Very different would it have been if the bath had been
got ready out of the child's sight; if when brought to the bedside
it had been covered with a blanket so as to hide the steam;
if the child had been laid upon the blanket, and gently let
down into the water, and this even without undressing him if
he were very fearful; and then if you wish to make a baby quite
happy in the water, put in a couple of bungs or corks with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>feathers stuck in them, for the baby to play with. Managed
thus, I have often seen the much-dreaded bath become a real
delight to the little one, and have found that if tears were shed
at all, it was at being taken out of the water, not at being placed
in it.</p>

<p>In a great variety of conditions, poultices are of use. They
are needed in the case of abscesses which it is wished to bring
to a head; they are sometimes applied over wounds which are
in an unhealthy condition, or from which it is desired to keep
up a discharge. They soothe the pain of stomach-ache from
any cause, and are of most essential service when constantly
applied in many forms of chest inflammation. And yet not
one mother or nurse in ten knows how to make a poultice.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>When applied over a wound they should not be covered with
oiled silk or any impermeable material, since the edges of the
wound and the adjacent skin are apt thereby to be rendered irritable
and to become covered with little itching pimples. When
used to relieve pain in the stomach, or as a warm application
in cases of inflammation of the chest, they should be covered
with some impermeable material, and will then not require to
be changed oftener than every six hours. After poultices have
been applied over the chest or stomach for two or three days
the skin is apt to become tender, and then it is well to substitute
for them what may be termed a dry poultice, which is
nothing else than a layer of dry cotton wool an inch or an
inch and a half thick, tacked inside a piece of oiled silk.</p>

<p>A handy substitute for a poultice may be made of bran
stitched in a flannel bag, heated by pouring boiling water on
it, then squeezed as dry as possible and laid over the painful
part. This is especially useful to relieve the stomach-ache of
infants and young children.</p>

<p>Spongio-piline is a useful substitute for a poultice, especially
when it is desirable to employ a soothing or stimulating liniment
to the surface. It retains heat very well when wrung out of
hot water, and any liniment sprinkled on it is brought into
contact with the skin much better than if diffused through a
poultice. I may just add that its edges should be sloped inwards,
in order to prevent the moisture from it oozing out and
wetting the child's night-dress.</p>

<p>When I was young, leeches and bleeding were frequently,
no doubt too frequently, employed. We have now, however,
gone too much to the other extreme, for cases are met with
from time to time of congestion of the brain, or of inflammation
of the chest or of the bowels, in which leeches bring greater
and more speedy relief than any other remedy. In applying
leeches it is always desirable that they should be put on where
they will be out of the child's sight if possible, and where it will
be comparatively easy to stop the bleeding. Hence, in many
instances of inflammation of the bowels, it is better to apply
the leeches at the edge of the lower bowel, the anus as it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>technically termed, than on the front of the stomach, though,
of course, this will not always answer the purpose. Leeches
to the chest may usually be put on just under the shoulder-blade;
and leeches to the head on one or other side behind
the ear, where they will be out of the way of any large vein, and
where the pressure of the finger will easily stop the bleeding.
Steady pressure with the finger will, even where there is no
bone to press against, usually effect this; and then a little pad
of lint put over the bite, and one or two layers over that, and
all fastened on with strips of adhesive plaster, will prevent any
renewal of the bleeding. In the few cases where it is not
arrested by these means, the application of a little of the solution
of muriate of iron will hardly fail of effect.</p>

<p>There is one more point to which I will refer before passing
lastly to the question of how to manage in the administration
of medicine; and this is the best way of applying cold to the
head. This is often ordered, but very seldom efficiently done.
Cold is best applied by means of a couple of bladders half-filled
with pounded ice, and wrapped in two large napkins;
one of them should be placed under the child's head, the
corners of the napkin being pinned to the pillow-case to prevent
its being disturbed, while the other is allowed to rest upon
the head, but with the corners of the napkin again pinned
to the pillow so as to take off the greater part of its weight.
Thus arranged, the cold application will neither get displaced
by the child's movements, nor will the child itself be wetted,
as it too commonly is when wet cloths are employed for
this purpose, nor irritated by their perpetual removal and
renewal.</p>

<p>In London and in large towns there are various contrivances
of vulcanised rubber, which are, of course, far preferable to the
bladders, but it is not everyone who lives in London, or who
can command the resources furnished by a large city.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the administration of medicine to
children are in great part the fault, either of the doctor in
giving needlessly unpleasant medicine, or of the parents or
nurse who either have failed to teach the child obedience, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>who are deficient in that tact by which hundreds of small
troubles are evaded.</p>

<p>As far as the doctor is concerned, all medicines should be
prescribed by him in small quantities, and as free from taste
and smell as possible: or where that cannot be, the unpleasant
flavour should be covered by syrup, or liquorice, or treacle.</p>

<p>Bulky powders should be avoided, and the child who has
learned to take rhubarb and magnesia, or Gregory's powder
without resistance, certainly does credit to his training.</p>

<p>Aperients are the medicines most frequently needed in the
minor ailments of children, and a wise mother will not undertake
herself the management of serious diseases. Of all
aperients castor oil is perhaps the safest, the least irritating, the
most generally applicable; it acts on the bowels and does nothing
more. The idea that it tends specially to produce constipation
afterwards is unfounded; it does not do so more than other
aperients. All aperients quicken for a time what is termed the
peristaltic action of the bowels; that is to say, their constant
movement in a direction from the stomach to the lower bowel,
which, as well as a contraction on themselves, is constantly
going on in every living animal, and continues even for some
time after death. The bowels stimulated to greater activity
of movement by the aperient, become for a time more sluggish
afterwards; they rest for a while, just as after a long walk the
muscles of the leg are weary and need repose.</p>

<p>There are indeed aperients which do more than this, as grey
powder and calomel act upon the liver, and so by promoting
an increased flow of bile cause a more permanent excitement
of the bowels, and consequently their more prolonged activity;
or as Epsom salts or citrate of magnesia, which by their action
on the blood cause a greater secretion or pouring out of
fluid from the coats of the intestines, and in this way have in
addition to their purgative property a special influence in
abating various feverish conditions.</p>

<p>Castor oil, senna, jalap, jalapine, and scammony are simple
aperients. They empty the bowels and nothing more, and in
cases of simple constipation, or where a child is ill either from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>eating too much or from taking indigestible food, are the best
purgatives that can be given. A dose of castor oil, often one
of the great griefs of the nursery, may generally be given without
the least difficulty if previously shaken up in a bottle with
a wine-glassful of hot milk sweetened and flavoured with a piece
of cinnamon boiled in it, by which all taste of the oil is effectually
concealed.</p>

<p>The domestic remedy, senna tea with prunes which render
it palatable, confection of senna, syrup of senna, and the sweet
essence of senna are generally very readily taken by children,
but all have the disadvantage of being liable to gripe. The
German liquorice powder, as it is called, which is composed of
powdered senna, liquorice powder, fennel, and a little sulphur
with white sugar, is freer from this drawback than any other
preparation, and when mixed with a little water is not generally
objected to. It is important, as senna is often adulterated and
loses its properties by exposure to the air, that this powder
should always be obtained from a very good chemist, purchased
in small quantities, and always kept in a glass-stoppered bottle.</p>

<p>Jalap, in the form in which it is usually sold&mdash;as compound
jalap powder&mdash;is in general readily taken; it acts speedily,
but often with pain, and is not a desirable domestic remedy.
Jalapine, which is a sort of extract of jalap, is much less apt to
gripe, and owing to its small bulk is much handier. It may be
given in doses of from two to five grains to children from two
years old and upwards.</p>

<p>Scammony is another powerful simple aperient, apt to be
violent in its action, and therefore not to be given except
when the bowels have long been confined, or when it is given
to expel worms. The compound scammony powder is the
form in which it is usually given, and of that five grains would
be a dose for a child two years old.</p>

<p>Scammony, however, is a costly drug, and therefore the
caution given with reference to German liquorice powder applies
here also.</p>

<p>There is a preparation of scammony, the so-called scammony
mixture, which consists of the resin or extract of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>scammony dissolved in milk, which is extremely useful when
the stomach is irritable, or there is much difficulty in inducing
the child to take medicine. It is almost tasteless, and a tablespoonful,
which would be a proper dose for a child of five
years old, can be given without being detected.</p>

<p>Much of the difficulty experienced in giving powders arises
from their being mixed with the arrowroot or jam in which
they are administered. A very small quantity of arrowroot,
bread and milk, or jam, should be put in a tea-spoon; the
powder then laid upon it, and covered over with the arrowroot
or jelly, so, in short, as to make a kind of sandwich, with the
powder, which would thus be untasted, in the middle.</p>

<p>Aloes is a purgative which acts chiefly on the large bowel
and to some degree also on the liver, and is of most use in the
habitual constipation of weakly children. In spite of its bitter
taste the powder is seldom objected to if given between two
layers of coarse brown sugar, while with most children the
addition of a teaspoonful of treacle will induce them to take
very readily that useful medicine, the compound decoction of
aloes.</p>

<p>Both rhubarb, aloes, and indeed other remedies which are
nauseous if given as a liquid and are bulky in the form of powder,
may very readily be given in extract in the form of very tiny
pills. Thus I have constantly ordered the extract of rhubarb,
which is nearly twice as strong as the powder, made up into
pills scarcely bigger than what children call 'hundreds and
thousands' and silver-coated. Ten or a dozen of these go
down in a teaspoonful of jelly unknown, and with no expenditure
of temper or tears.</p>

<p>The citrate of magnesia, or Dinneford's Magnesia, taken
effervescing with lemon juice, or when the effervescence has
passed off, or the French Limonade Purgative, are almost
always very readily taken, and are often very useful in the
little febrile attacks, or in the slight feverish rashes to which
children are liable in the spring and autumn.</p>

<p>Mercurials should have no place among domestic remedies.
I do not mean that the doctor need be called in to prescribe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>each time that they are given, but that the mother should
learn from him distinctly with reference to each individual
child the circumstances which justify their employment.
They stimulate the liver, as well as produce thereby action of
the bowels, but they have, especially if often employed, a far-reaching
influence on the constitution, and that undoubtedly
of a depressing kind: an influence more than made up for
when really needed by their other qualities, and especially by
their power in doing away with the results of many forms of
chronic inflammation. They are 'edged tools,' however, and
we know the proverb about those who play with them.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Grey powder, blue pill, and calomel are the three forms in
one or other of which mercurials are commonly given. Of the
three, grey powder is the mildest; but it has the inconvenience
of not infrequently causing nausea, or actual sickness. This
objection does not apply to blue pill, which can be given either
in the tiny pills of which I have already spoken, or else
broken down, and given in a little jam, or in a teaspoonful of
syrup or treacle. On the whole I prefer calomel in small
doses. It has the great advantage of tastelessness, small bulk,
and of never causing sickness. Half a grain of calomel may
be regarded as equivalent to two grains of grey powder or blue
pill.</p>

<p>I shall speak afterwards of other medicines, which may in
various circumstances be given, to act upon the bowels; but
the above include all that are at all fit for common use in the
nursery.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject I will add a word or two about
the use of suppositories and lavements in infancy and childhood.
A piece of paper rolled up into a conical form and
greased, or a bit of soap, is not infrequently introduced by
nurses just within the bowel, as a means of overcoming constipation
in infants. The irritation of the muscle at its orifice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>(the sphincter, as it is termed) excites the bowels to action,
and does away with the necessity for giving an aperient. The
drawback from this, as well as from the use of the lavement, is
that if frequently employed they become habitually necessary,
and the bowels will then never act without their customary
stimulus. The lavement, too, has the additional disadvantage
that while the lower part of the bowel is in proportion more
capacious in infancy and childhood than in the adult, this
peculiarity becomes exaggerated by the constant distension of
the intestine, and a larger and still larger quantity of fluid
needs to be thrown up in order to produce the requisite action
of the bowels.</p>

<p>Opiates and other soothing medicines should never be
given except when prescribed by the doctor. Thirty-two
deaths in England under five years of age in 1882 represent
but a very small part of the evil wrought by the overdose
or injudicious use of these remedies. Above all, soothing
medicines of varying strength, as syrup of poppies, or of
unknown composition, as Dalby's Carminative or Winslow's
Soothing Syrup, should never be employed. The only safe
preparation, and this to be given only by the doctor's orders
or with his approval, is the compound tincture of camphor, or
paregoric elixir, as it is called, of which sixty measured drops
contain a quarter of a grain of opium. Ten to fifteen measured
drops of this are a sufficient dose for a child one year
old, and this ought not to be repeated within twelve hours.
The repetition every few hours of small doses of opiates is
quite as hazardous as the giving of a single overdose; and if
it does not work serious mischief by stupefying the child, it
renders it impossible to judge of its real condition.</p>

<p>Thus much may suffice with reference to the more important
remedies. Others will necessarily call for notice when
the diseases come to be considered in which they may be of
service.</p>

<p>There are two points which still remain to be noticed before
I leave the introductory part of this little book.</p>

<p>The first of these concerns the importance of keeping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>written notes in the course of every case of serious illness.
For want of doing this the most imperfect and conflicting
accounts of what has happened are given to the doctor. No
person can watch to any good purpose for four-and-twenty
hours together; and no one's memory, least of all in the midst
of fatigue and anxiety, can correctly retain all details concerning
medicine, food, and sleep, which yet it may be of paramount
importance that the doctor should be made acquainted with.
I am accustomed to desire a record to be kept on a sheet of
paper divided into six columns, one for food, a second for
medicine, a third for sleep, a fourth for the evacuations, and a
fifth for any special point which the nature of the illness renders
it of special moment to observe, while the date is entered
on the first column of all, indicating when food or medicine
was given, or when and for how long the child slept. It is
best to enter the variations of temperature on a separate paper,
in order that the doctor may at a glance perceive the daily
changes in this important respect. No one who has not
made the experiment can tell the relief which the keeping this
simple record gives to the anxiety of nursing the sick, especially
when the sick one is loved most tenderly.</p>

<p>The other point concerns the relations of the mother or of
the parents to the doctor. I have often heard it said, 'Dr. Green
always attends my husband and myself, but we have Dr. White
for the servants and children,' implying a lower degree of
medical knowledge as required in their case, and to be acknowledged
by a lower rate of remuneration.</p>

<p>Need I say that the assumption is a mistaken one&mdash;that as
much knowledge, as large experience, are needed in the one
case as in the other; while over and above, to treat children
successfully, a special tact and a special fondness for children
are needed? A man may be a very good doctor without those
special gifts; but their possession, apart from real medical
knowledge, may make a good children's nurse, but never a
good children's doctor.</p>

<p>Another matter not to be forgotten is the confidence to be
reposed in the doctor&mdash;the readiness to acquiesce in his sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>visiting the child more frequently in the course of an
illness than the symptoms may seem to you to require. Were
you involved in some civil action, in which your succession to
large property was involved, you would scarcely expect your
solicitor to give you his opinion on all the questions at a single
interview. In the same way, the doctor, even the most
experienced, may need to visit his little patient several times
before he can feel quite certain as to the nature of the disease
that is impending, while he may not wish to alarm you by
suggesting all the possibilities that are present to his mind.
The child after a restless night may be asleep, and it may be
most undesirable to wake him; or he may be excessively cross
and unmanageable, so that it is impossible to listen to his chest;
or it may be very important to ascertain whether the high
temperature present in the morning has risen still higher towards
night, or whether, after free action of the bowels, it has fallen
a degree or two, showing that no fever is impending, but that
the undue heat of the body was occasioned by the constipation.
Or, again, some remedy may have been ordered, of the effect
of which the doctor does not feel quite sure: he wishes to see
for himself whether it is right to continue or wiser to suspend
it. The wise physician, like the able general, leaves as little as
may be to chance.</p>

<p>Nearly forty years ago, in addressing a class of medical
students, I said to them:</p>

<p>'If you are carefully to observe all the points which I have
mentioned, and to make yourselves thoroughly masters of a case,
you must be lavish of your time; you must be content to turn
aside from the direct course of investigation, which you would
pursue uninterruptedly in the adult, in order to soothe the waywardness
of the child, to quiet its fears, or even to cheat it into
good humour by joining in its play; and you must be ready to
do this, not the first time only, but every time that you visit the
child, and must try to win its affections in order to cure its
disease. If you fail in the former, you will often be foiled in
your attempts at the latter. Nor is this all; you must visit
your patient very often if the disease is serious in its nature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>and rapid in its course. New symptoms succeed each other in
infancy and childhood with great rapidity; complications occur
that call for some change in your treatment, or the vital powers
falter suddenly when you least expect it. The issues of life
and death often hang on the immediate adoption of a certain
plan of treatment, or on its timely discontinuance. Do not
wait, therefore, for symptoms of great urgency before you visit
a child three or four times a day; but if the disease is one in
which changes are likely to take place rapidly, be frequent in
your visits as well as watchful in your observation.'</p>

<p>Each year has added to my conviction of the perfect truth
of each word which I have quoted. If you believe your doctor
to be a man of integrity and intelligence, be thankful for his
frequent visits, which will cease as his anxiety abates. Be
convinced that in the mean time they are made, not for his
sake, but for yours. If you doubt his integrity, change your
doctor; but do not say to him in a tone and with an emphasis
which there is no mistaking, 'Well, if you think it <i>really</i>
necessary to come'!</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5" href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I add in this note a few simple directions for making poultices,
though, as I have stated in my preface, it is no part of my purpose to enter
into all the details, important though they are, of a sick nurse's duties.</p>

<p>For a linseed meal poultice, see that the water is <i>boiling</i>, not merely
hot; warm the basin, put the water in <i>first</i>; sprinkle the meal on it,
stirring the whole time, till it becomes of the uniform consistency of
porridge, then spread it about half an inch thick over the linen, or whatever
it is spread on, and turn up the edges for an inch all round to prevent
the poultice crumbling and soiling the night-dress; and then having smeared
the surface with a little oil, test its warmth by applying it to your cheek
before putting it on the patient. A broad bandage of some sort or a soft
towel must then be put round the body to keep the poultice in its place,
and secured with safety pins.</p>

<p>Pure mustard poultices are never used in children, on account of the
pain they occasion, and the too great irritation which they would cause
of the delicate skin of children. A mixture of one part of mustard to
two of linseed meal is, however, often of much use in the chest affections
of children.</p>

<p>Bread poultices are less generally useful than those of linseed meal.
They do not retain the heat nearly so well as those of linseed meal, and
are chiefly used in cuts, wounds, or small abscesses; and also because they
are so easily made. A slice of stale bread without the crust is put on a
plate, boiling water is poured over it, and drained off; it is then placed on a
piece of muslin, pressed between two plates to squeeze out the remaining
water, and its surface is greased before it is applied with a little oil or lard.
I would refer for details about how to make poultices, and for many other
things well worth the knowing, to Miss Wood's <i>Handbook of Nursing</i>,
London, 12mo, 1883.</p></div>

infancy and childhood.</p>

<p>Any attempt at scientific arrangement of a popular book

convenience of my readers. I think I do so best by considering
first the disorders which beset the child in the first month of
its existence, during what may be termed its transition from
the condition of existence in the womb, to its living, breathing
state as an inhabitant of this world; and next the more
important ailments to which it is liable during that important
time of development which ends with the completion of
teething. Afterwards may be studied the diseases of the head,
the chest, and the bowels; next constitutional diseases, such as
consumption and scrofula; and lastly, the various fevers, as
typhoid, or, as it is popularly called, remittent fever, measles,
scarlatina, and small-pox; and last of all I will add a few
remarks on the mental and moral characteristics of childhood,
and their disorders.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ON THE DISORDERS AND DISEASES OF CHILDREN DURING
THE FIRST MONTH AFTER BIRTH.</h3>


<p><b>Still-birth.</b>&mdash;The infant cries almost as soon as it comes
into the world. The cry is the evidence that air has entered
its lungs, that the blood has now begun to take a different
course from that which it followed before birth, and that the
child has entered on a new existence. The child who does not
cry, does not breathe; it is said to be <i>still-born</i>; its quietude
means death.</p>

<p>After a long or a difficult labour, or after the use of instruments,
the child is sometimes still-born in consequence of
blood being poured out on its brain, and it is thus killed before
birth by apoplexy. This, however, is not usually the case, but
the child is generally still-born because some cause or other,
generally the protraction of labour, interfered with the due
changes of its blood within the womb, and it is born suffocated
before its birth, and consequently unable to make the necessary
efforts to breathe afterwards.</p>

<p>Drowned people are often resuscitated; the child's case is
analogous to theirs; and in both the same measures have to be
pursued, namely to try to establish respiration. The degree of
the warmth of the child's body, the resistance of its muscles,
the red tint or the white colour of its surface, the presence or
absence of perceptible beating of its heart, measure the chances
of success. Sometimes mere exposure to the cold air produces
the necessary effect; at other times breathing is excited by
dashing cold water in the child's face, by slapping it, by tickling its
nostrils, or by dipping it for a few seconds in a hot bath at 100&deg;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>or 102&deg;; and then swinging it a few times backwards and forwards
in the air.</p>

<p>Much time, however, must not be lost over these proceedings,
but the child must be laid on its back, the lower part of
its body well wrapped up, the chest slightly raised by a folded
napkin placed under it. The two arms must then be taken
firmly, raised and slowly extended on either side of the head,
then brought down again and gently pressed on either side of
the chest; and this movement of alternate raising and extending
the arms and bringing them back again beside the chest
must be repeated regularly some thirty times in the minute,
thus imitating the movements of the chest in breathing. These
efforts, too, must not be discontinued so long as the surface
retains its warmth, and as an occasional heart-beat shows that
life is not absolutely extinct; and I believe that in many
instances failure is due to want of perseverance rather than to
the absolute uselessness of the measure.</p>

<p><b>Premature Birth.</b>&mdash;In spite of very extraordinary exceptions,
it may be laid down as a rule that children born before
the completion of six and a half months of pregnancy do not
survive. After that date, each additional week adds greatly to
the chances of the child living. There is a mistaken idea,
founded on a superstition connected with the number seven,
that a seven-months child is more likely to survive than one
born at the eighth month. But this notion is as destitute of
support in fact as it is opposed to common sense, and the
nearer any woman has approached the full term of forty weeks
of pregnancy, the greater are the chances of her child being
born alive and healthy.</p>

<p>The premature child is by no means necessarily still-born.
It breathes, but does so imperfectly, so that air does not enter
all the smaller air-cells; and its voice is a whimper rather than
a cry. Those changes in the heart and large vessels, which
prepare, as pregnancy draws to a close, for the altered course of
the blood when the child has to breathe through the lungs, are
too little advanced for it to bear well the sudden alteration
in its mode of being. The feebly beating heart and the not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>completely developed lungs seem but imperfectly to maintain
the bodily heat. The glands of the stomach and intestines
are not yet fit to perform digestion properly, while the muscular
power is too feeble for the effort at sucking. Everything is
sketched out, but to nothing has the finishing touch been put,
and hence the frail machinery too often breaks down, in the
endeavour to discharge its functions.</p>

<p>It is surprising, however, with what rapidity Nature in some
instances perfects the work which she has been called on prematurely
to perform.</p>

<p>It is our business to second Nature's endeavours. First of
all, and of most importance, is the duty of providing from without
the warmth which the child is unable to generate. When
very feeble, it must, even without any previous washing or
dressing, be at once wrapped in cotton wool, and then in a hot
blanket, and surrounded with hot-water bottles. A tin stomach-warmer
filled with hot water is very convenient to place under
the blanket on which the child lies. Being too feeble to suck,
it must be fed, a few drops at a time, from a small spoon; or
still better, if it is able to make any effort at sucking, it may
draw its nourishment through a quill. The mother after a
premature confinement is almost sure to have no milk with
which to nourish her child, at any rate for two or three days.
It is, therefore, wise to obtain the help of a woman with a
healthy baby. She must be allowed to bring her baby with
her, since otherwise her supply of milk would fail, especially if
she had no other means of getting rid of it than by the breast-pump
or by drawing her breast. Even though she may have
her own baby, there are few women who can submit, for more
than a very few days, to the artificial emptying their breast
without the secretion being either greatly lessened or altogether
arrested. This, therefore, must be regarded as a resource
available only for a few days, and as the child gains strength
every effort must be made to get it to take its mother's breast,
if she has any supply, or that of the wet-nurse. If this is found
impossible, it will be wisest to give up, at any rate for the
present, the attempt to nourish the child from the breast, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>to obtain for it asses' milk, which is the best substitute. By no
means whatever can more than from a sixth to a fourth part
of a pint of milk be obtained either by the breast-pump or by
drawing the breast; and since a healthy infant of a few weeks
old sucks about two pints of milk in twenty-four hours, it is
evident that the supply artificially obtained must after the first
few days be utterly inadequate.</p>

<p>I have in cases of extreme weakness in premature children
succeeded in preserving them by giving them every two hours
for two or three days ten measured drops of raw beef juice,
five of brandy, and two teaspoonfuls of breast milk. Medicine
has no place in the management of these cases; the question
is one entirely of warmth, food, and for a time the judicious
use of stimulants.</p>

<p><b>Imperfect Expansion of the Lungs.</b>&mdash;Children not
premature and perfectly well nourished are yet sometimes
feeble, breathe imperfectly, cry weakly, suck difficultly or not
at all, and die at the end of a few days. Their lamp of life
flickered and went out. Such cases are met with for the most
part in conditions similar to those in which children are
actually still-born; or now and then they take place when
labour has been of unusually short duration, the child hurried
into the world too rapidly; while in other instances it is not
possible to account for their occurrence.</p>

<p>For a long time the nature of these cases was not understood;
but rather more than sixty years ago a German
physician discovered that air had entered the lungs but imperfectly;
that perhaps a third, perhaps even as much as half,
of the lungs had never been dilated, but had remained solid
and useless; that in consequence the blood was but half-purified,
and vitality therefore but half-sustained. The lungs,
however, were found to have undergone no real change; they
were not diseased, but if air was blown into them the dark
solid patches sunk below the level of the surrounding substance,
expanded, grew bright in colour and like a sponge from which
the water has been squeezed, and crackled, or crepitated as
the technical term is, from the air contained within them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>We breathe in health so without conscious effort that we
never realise the fact that, according to the calculation of
most competent observers, the mere elasticity of the lungs,
independent even of the elasticity of the chest walls, opposes
a resistance to each inspiration equal to 150 pounds avoirdupois
in the grown man and 120 in the grown woman. The
want of breath puts the respiratory muscles into play: the
man takes a deep inspiration, and by this unconscious effort,
he overcomes the resistance of the chest and the elasticity
of the lungs. The new-born infant feels the same want and
makes the same effort; but its muscular power is small,
and its inspirations are often so feeble as to draw the air
in some parts only into the larger tubes, while many of the
smaller remain undilated, and much of the lung continues in
the state in which it was before birth. The blood being thus
but imperfectly purified, all the processes of nutrition go on
imperfectly, the vital powers languish, the inspiratory efforts
become more and more feeble, while the elasticity of the
lung is constantly tending to empty the small cells of air and
to oppose its entrance, and next the temperature sinks and the
infant dies.</p>

<p>Cases in which this condition of the lungs exists usually
present the history of the child from the very first having
failed to utter a strong and loud cry like that of other children.
Even after breathing has gone on for some time, such children
usually appear feeble, and they suck with difficulty, although
they often make the effort. An infant thus affected sleeps
even more than new-born infants usually do; its voice is very
feeble, and rather a whimper than a cry. In the cry of the
healthy infant you at once detect two parts&mdash;the loud cry,
suffering or passionate as the case may be, and the less loud
back draught of inspiration. The French have two words for
these two sounds&mdash;the <i>cri</i> and the <i>reprise</i>. The <i>cri</i> is feeble,
the <i>reprise</i> is altogether wanting wherever expansion of the
lung has to any considerable extent failed to take place, and
you would hail this second sound as the best proof of an
improvement in the child's condition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>If you watch the child with a little attention you will see
that while the chest moves up and down, it is very little, if at
all, dilated by the respiratory movements. The temperature
falls, the skin becomes pale, and the lips grow livid, and often
slight twitching is observed about the muscles of the face.
The difficulty in sucking increases, the cry grows weaker and
more whimpering, or even altogether inaudible, while breathing
is attended with a slight rattle or a feeble cough, and the
convulsive movements return more frequently, and are no
longer confined to the face, but affect also the muscles of the
extremities. Any sudden movement suffices to bring on these
convulsive seizures, but even while perfectly still the child's
condition is not uniform, but it will suddenly become convulsed,
and during this seizure the respiration will be extremely
difficult, and death will seem momentarily impending. In a
few minutes, however, all this disturbance ceases, and the
extreme weakness of the child, its inability to suck, its feeble
cry, and its frequent and imperfect inspirations, are the only
abiding indications of the serious disorder from which it
suffers. But the other symptoms return again and again,
until after the lapse of a few days or a few weeks the infant
dies.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at some length on this condition because it is
important to know that during the first few weeks of life real
inflammation of the lungs or air-tubes is of extremely rare
occurrence, and that the symptoms which are not infrequently
supposed to depend on it are really due to a portion of the
lung more or less extensive never having been called into
proper activity. I may add that we shall hereafter have to
notice a similar condition of the lung&mdash;its collapse after having
once been inflated&mdash;as occurring sometimes in the course of
real inflammation of the organs of respiration in early life, and
forming a very serious complication of the original disease.</p>

<p>If the collapse of the lung is not so considerable as to
destroy life within the first few hours or days after birth, the
babe wastes as well as grows weaker and weaker, and this wasting
coupled with the difficult breathing not seldom causes the fear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>that the child has been born consumptive and that its death is
inevitable.</p>

<p>No such gloomy view need be taken. Collapse, or at least
non-expansion of the lung to some extent, is by no means
unusual: consumptive disease to such an extent in the new-born
infant as to interfere with the establishment of breathing
is extremely rare. The consumptive babe can suck, it is not
so weak as the one whose lungs are imperfectly expanded; it
has no convulsive twitchings, nor any of the strange head-symptoms
which we notice in the former. It wastes less
rapidly, it is feverish instead of having a lower temperature
than natural, it seems less ill, and yet its death within a few
weeks or months is absolutely certain; while the child whose
lungs are not diseased but simply unexpanded may, if that
accidental condition is removed, grow up to vigorous manhood.</p>

<p>The treatment of these cases is abundantly simple. The
child who breathes imperfectly but ill maintains its heat. It
must be kept warm at a temperature never less than 70&deg;; it
may, like the premature child, need stimulants, and all the precautions
already mentioned as to feeding. Twice in the day it
should be put for five minutes in a hot bath at 100&deg;, rendered
even more stimulating by the addition of a little mustard. The
back and chest may be rubbed from time to time with a stimulating
liniment, and an emetic of ipecacuanha wine may be
given twice a day. The act of vomiting not only removes any
of the mucus which is apt to accumulate in the larger air tubes,
but the powerful inspirations which follow the effort tend to introduce
air into the smallest vesicles of the lungs, and to do away
with their collapse.</p>

<p>Let these directions be carried out sensibly, patiently, perseveringly,
and three times out of four, or oftener still, the
mother's ear will before many days be greeted by the loud cry,
with its <i>cri</i> and <i>reprise</i> of which I have already spoken, and
which assures her that her little one will live.</p>

<p>There are no other affections of the lungs so peculiar to the
first month of life as to call for notice here. I shall have a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>observations to make about malformations of the heart, and
the precautions for which they call in the after-life of children;
but they will find their fittest place in the chapter on Affections
of the Chest.</p>

<p><b>Jaundice of New-born Children.</b>&mdash;A certain yellow
tinge of the skin, unattended by any other sign of jaundice,
such as the yellowness of the eye and the dark colour of the
urine, is by no means to be confounded with real jaundice. It
is no real jaundice, but is merely the result of the changes
which the blood with which the small vessels of the skin are
overcharged at birth is undergoing; the redness fading as
bruises fade, through shades of yellow into the genuine flesh
colour.</p>

<p>This is no disease, to be treated with the grey powder and the
castor oil wherewith the over-busy monthly nurse is always ready.
It is a natural process, which the intelligent may watch with
interest, with which none but the ignorant will try to interfere.</p>

<p>There is, however, beside this a real jaundice, in which
the skin is more deeply stained, the whites of the eyes are
yellow, the urine high-coloured, and in which the dark evacuations
that carry away the contents of the bowels before birth
are succeeded by white motions, from which the bile is absent.
This condition is not very usual, save where children have been
exposed to cold, or where the air they breathe is unwholesome.
Of this no better proof can be given than is afforded by the
fact that in the Dublin Lying-in Hospital, where the children
are defended with the greatest care both from cold and from a
vitiated atmosphere, infantile jaundice is extremely rare, while it
attacks three-fourths of the children received into the Foundling
Hospital of Paris. Still it does sometimes occur when yet
no cause can be assigned for it, and it is noteworthy that it is
sometimes met with in successive infants in the same family.</p>

<p>As the respiratory function and that of the skin increase
in activity, the jaundice will disappear of its own accord. Great
attention must be paid during its continuance to avoid exposure
of the child to cold, while no other food than the mother's
milk should be given. If the bowels are at all constipated, half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>a grain of grey powder or a quarter of a grain of calomel may be
given, followed by a small dose of castor oil, and the aperient
will often seem to hasten the disappearance of the jaundice;
but in a large number of cases even this amount of medical
interference is not needed.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a very grave form of jaundice, happily of
excessive rarity, due to malformation of the liver, to absence
or obstruction of the bile-ducts, and often accompanied with
bleeding from the navel. I do but mention it; the intensity
and daily deepening of the jaundice, the fruitlessness of all
treatment, and the grave illness of the child, even though no
bleeding should occur, render it impossible to confound this
hopeless condition with the trivial ailment of which I have been
speaking.</p>

<p>The next chapter will furnish a fitter place than the present
for speaking fully of the Disorders of the Digestive Organs.</p>

<p>I will say now but this: that whatever a mother may do
eventually, she avoids grave perils for herself by suckling her
infant for the first month; while the health of her child, just
launched upon the world, is terribly endangered if fed upon
those substitutes for its proper nutriment on which after the
lapse of a few weeks it may subsist, may even manage to
thrive.</p>

<p>There are some local affections incident to the new-born
child concerning which a few words may not be out of place;
and first of the</p>

<p><b>Ophthalmia of New-born Children.</b>&mdash;It is the cause
of the loss of sight of nine-tenths of all persons who, among
the poor, are said to have been born blind. In the wealthier
classes of society it is comparatively rare, and seldom fails to
meet with timely treatment, yet many people scarcely realise its
dangerous character, or the extreme rapidity of its course.</p>

<p>It generally begins about the third day after birth with
swelling of the lid of one or other eye, though both are
soon involved. The eyelids swell rapidly, and if the affection
is let alone, they soon put on the appearance of two semi-transparent
cushions over the eyes. On separating the lids,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>which it is often very difficult to do owing to the spasmodic
contraction of the muscles, their inner surface is seen to be
enormously swollen, bright red, like scarlet velvet, bathed in
an abundant yellowish thin secretion, which often squirts out
in a jet as the lids are forcibly separated. Great care must be
taken not to allow any of this fluid to enter the eye of a bystander,
nor to touch his own eye until the fingers have been
most carefully washed, since the discharge is highly contagious,
and may produce most dangerous inflammation of the eyes
of any grown person. The discharge being wiped or washed
away, the eye itself may be seen at the bottom of the swelling
very red, and its small vessels very blood-shot. By degrees the
surface of the eye assumes a deeper red, it loses its brightness
and its polish, while the swelling of the lids lessens, and they
can be opened with less difficulty; their inner surface at the
same time becomes softer, but thick and granular, and next the
eyes themselves put on likewise a granular condition which obscures
vision. The discharge by this time has become thicker
and white, and looks like matter from an abscess. By slow
degrees the inflammation may subside, the discharge lessen,
the swelling diminish, and the eye in the course of weeks may
regain its natural condition. But the danger is&mdash;and when
proper treatment is not adopted early the danger is very great&mdash;lest
the mischief should extend beyond the surface of the eye,
lest ulceration of the eye should take place, the ulceration
reach so deep as to perforate it, and not merely interfere with
the sight, but destroy the organ of vision altogether.</p>

<p>In every instance, then, in which the eyelids of a new-born
infant swell, or the slightest discharge appears from them, the
attention of the doctor must at once be called to the condition.
In the meantime, and during whatever treatment he may think
it right to follow, the eye must be constantly covered with a
piece of folded lint dipped in cold water; and every hour at
least the eye must be opened and tepid water squeezed into it
abundantly from a sponge held above, but not touching it, so
as to completely wash away all the discharge. A weak solution
of alum and zinc, as one grain of the latter to three of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>former to an ounce of water, may in like manner be dropped
from a large camel's-hair brush four times a day into the eye
after careful washing. Simple as these measures are they yet
suffice, if adopted at the very beginning, and carried on perseveringly,
to entirely cure in a few days an ailment which if let
alone leads almost always to most lamentable results.</p>

<p>I do not pursue the subject further, for bad cases require all
the care of the most skilful oculist for their treatment.</p>

<p><b>Scalp Swellings.</b>&mdash;Almost every new-born child has on
one or other side of its head a puffy swelling, owing to the
pressure to which the head has been subjected in birth, and
this swelling disappears at the end of twenty-four or forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, though indeed very seldom, the
swelling does not disappear, but it goes on gradually increasing
and becoming more definite in its outlines until at the end of
three or four days it may be as big as half a small orange, or
sometimes even larger, soft, elastic, painless, under the unchanged
scalp, but presenting the peculiarity of having a hard
raised margin with a distinct edge, which gives to the finger
passed over it the sensation of a bony ridge, beyond which the
bone seems deficient. This tumour is due usually to the same
cause as that which produces the other temporary puffy swelling
of the scalp, only the pressure having been more severe, blood
has actually been forced out from the small vessels under the
membrane which covers the skull, and hence its gradual increase,
its definite outline; and hence, too, the bony ridge
which surrounds it, and which is due to nature's effort at cure,
in the course of which the raised edge of the membrane
covering the skull (the <i>pericranium</i>) becomes converted into
bone.</p>

<p>When the nature of these swellings was not understood,
they used to be poulticed, and to be opened with a lancet to
let out their contents. We know now, however, that we have
nothing to do but to let them alone; that by degrees the
blood will be absorbed and the tumour will disappear, and as
it does so we may trace the gradual transformation of the membrane
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>which covered it into bone, as we feel it crackling like tinsel
under the finger. Two, three, or four weeks may be needed
for the entire removal of one of these blood-swellings. The
doctor will at once recognise its character, and you will then
have nothing to do but to wait&mdash;often, unhappily, so much
harder for the anxious mother than to meddle.</p>

<p><b>Ruptured Navel.</b>&mdash;There is a period some time before
the birth of a child when the two halves of its body are not
united in front, as they become afterwards; and hare-lip or
cleft-palate sometimes remains as the result of the arrest of
that development which should have closed the fissured lip or
united the two halves of the palate.</p>

<p>In a similar way it happens sometimes that though the
skin is closed, the muscles of the stomach (or, more properly
speaking, of the belly) are not in the close apposition in which
they should be, so that the bowels are not supported by the
muscles, but protected only by the skin.</p>

<p>More frequently than this, especially in the case of children
who are born before the time, the opening through which the
navel string passes is large at birth, and fails to close as speedily
and completely as it should do afterwards. When everything
goes on as it ought, the gradual contraction of the opening
helps to bring about the separation of the navel string and its
detachment, and the perfect closure of the opening takes place
at the same time, between the fifth and the eighth day after
birth.</p>

<p>If this does not occur, the bowels are very apt to protrude
through the opening, and if allowed to do so for weeks
or months, the opening becomes so dilated that its closure
is impossible, and the child grows up afflicted permanently
with rupture through the navel. This is always an inconvenience,
sometimes even a source of serious danger; but if means
are taken to prevent the condition becoming worse, nature
seldom fails eventually to bring about a cure, and to effect the
complete closure of the opening.</p>

<p>If the muscles on either side do not come into apposition,
but leave a cleft between them, the infant should constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>wear a broad bandage of fine flannel round the stomach, not
applied too tightly, in order to give support. The circular
bandages of vulcanised india-rubber with a pad in the centre
are nowise to be recommended. The pad is apt to become
displaced, and to press anywhere but over the navel, while its
edges irritate the infant's delicate skin, and the pressure which
it exerts if it is sufficiently tight to retain its place interferes
with respiration.</p>

<h3>ON THE DISORDERS AND DISEASES OF CHILDREN AFTER THE
FIRST MONTH, AND UNTIL TEETHING IS FINISHED.</h3>


<p><b>Infantile Atrophy.</b>&mdash;In by far the greater number of
instances, the wasting of young children is due to their being
fed upon food which they cannot digest, or which when digested
fails to yield them proper nourishment. I quoted some figures
in my introductory remarks, to show from the evidence obtained
at Berlin how much larger was the proportion of deaths under
the age of one year among hand-fed infants than among those
brought up at the breast. Foundling hospitals on the Continent,
in which the children are all drawn from the same class, and
subjected in all respects to a similar treatment, except that in
some they are fed at the breast, in others brought up by hand,
show a mortality in the latter case exactly double of that in the
former.</p>

<p>It is as idle to ignore these facts, and to adduce in their
disproof the case of some child brought up most successfully
by hand, as it would be to deny that a battle-field was a place
of danger because some people had been present there and
had come away unwounded.</p>

<p>But it is always well not merely to accept a fact, but also
to know the reason why a thing is so. The reason is twofold:
partly because the different substitutes for the mother's milk,
taken for the most part from the vegetable kingdom, are less
easy of digestion than the milk, and partly because, even were
they digested with the same facility, they do not furnish the
elements necessary to support life in due proportion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>All food has to answer two distinct purposes: the one to
furnish materials for the growth of the body, the other to afford
matter for the maintenance of its temperature; and life cannot
be supported except on a diet in which the elements of
nutrition and those of respiration bear a certain proportion to
each other. Now, in milk, the proper food of infants, the
elements of the former are to those of the latter about in the
proportion of 1 to 2, while in arrowroot, sago, and tapioca they
are only as 1 to 26, and in wheaten flour only as 1 to 7. If to
this we add the absence in these substances of the oleaginous
matters which the milk contributes to supply the body with
fat, and the smaller quantity, and to a certain extent the
different kind, of the salts which they contain, it becomes
apparent that by such a diet the health if not the life of the
infant must almost inevitably be sacrificed.</p>

<p>But these substances are not only less nutritious, they
are also less easy of digestion than the infant's natural food.
We all know how complex is the digestive apparatus of the
herbivorous animal, of which the four stomachs of the ruminants
are an instance, and how large is the bulk of food in proportion
to his size which the elephant requires, compared with that
which suffices for the lion or the tiger.</p>

<p>The stomach of the infant is the simple stomach of the
carnivorous animal, intended for food which shall not need to
stay long in that receptacle, but shall be speedily digested; and
it is only as the child grows older, and takes more varied food,
that the stomach alters somewhat in form, that it assumes a
more rounded shape, resembling somewhat that of the herbivorous
animal, and suited to retain the food longer. The
young of all creatures live upon their mother for a certain time
after birth; but in all the preparation for a different kind of
food, and with it for an independent existence, begins much
sooner and goes on more rapidly than in man. Young rabbits
are always provided with two teeth when born, and the others
make their appearance within ten days. In the different
ruminants the teeth have either begun to appear before birth,
or they show themselves a few days afterwards; and in either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>case dentition is completed within the first month, and in dogs
and cats within the first ten weeks of existence.</p>

<p>In the human subject the process of teething begins late,
between the seventh and the ninth month, and goes on slowly:
the first grinding teeth are seldom cut before the beginning of
the second year, and teething is not finished until after its end.
Until teething has begun the child ought to live exclusively on
the food which nature provides; for until that time the internal
organs have not become fitted to digest other sustenance,
and the infant deprived of this too often languishes and dies.
To get from other food the necessary amount of nourishment,
that food has to be taken in larger quantities, and, from the
difficulty in digesting it, needs to remain longer in the stomach
than the mother's milk. One of the results of the indigestibility
of the food is that the child is often sick, the stomach getting
rid of a part of that food which it is unable to turn to any
useful purpose; and so far well. But the innutritious substances
do not relieve the sense of hunger. The child cries in
discomfort, and more is given to it, and by degrees the over-distended
stomach becomes permanently dilated, and holds a
larger quantity than it was originally meant to contain. The
undigested mass passes into a state of fermentation, and the
infant's breath becomes sour and offensive, it suffers from wind
and acid eructations, and nurses sometimes express surprise
that the child does not thrive since it is always hungry. While
some of the food is got rid of by vomiting, some passes into
the intestines, and there becomes putrid, as the horribly offensive
evacuations prove. They come away, large and solid and
white, for the secretion of the bile is inadequate to complete
that second digestion which should take place in the intestines;
or else the irritation which they excite occasions diarrh&oelig;a&mdash;a
green putty-like matter comes away mixed with a profuse
watery discharge.</p>

<p>What wonder is it that in such circumstances the body
should waste most rapidly; for it is forced from its own tissues
to supply those elements essential to the maintenance of life,
which its food contains in far too scanty a proportion. Every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>organ of the body contributes to the general support, and
life is thus prolonged, if no kind disease curtail it, until each
member has furnished all that it can spare, and then death
takes place from starvation, its approach having been slower,
but the suffering which preceded it not therefore less, than if
all food had been withheld.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that in this description I have been
painting too dark a picture, or that children who die thus have
been exceptionally weak, and so under the acknowledged
difficulties of hand-feeding at length became consumptive.
They do not die of consumption, and in a large number of
instances their bodies show no trace of consumptive disease,
but present appearances characteristic of this condition of
starvation, and of this only.</p>

<p>Along the whole track of the stomach and intestines are
the signs of irritation and inflammation. The glands of the
bowels are enlarged, actual ulceration of the stomach is often
met with; while so far-reaching is the influence of this slow
starvation, that even the substance of the kidneys and of the
brain are often found softened and otherwise altered, though
it might not unreasonably have been supposed that these organs
lay quite beyond the reach of any disorder of digestion.</p>

<p>No doubt all these grievous results do not always follow;
and sometimes children exceptionally strong manage to take
and digest enough even of unsuitable food to maintain their
health, and may as they grow up, and the changes take place in
the system which fit it for a varied diet, even become robust.
In the majority of instances, however, hand-fed infants, and
those especially who have been brought up chiefly on farinaceous
food, are less strong than others, and are more apt to develop
any latent tendency to hereditary disease, such as scrofula or
consumption, than members of the same family who have been
brought up at the breast.</p>

<p>Enough has already been said to satisfy all but those who
do not wish to be convinced, how incumbent it is on every
mother to try to suckle her child. But though it is most desirable
that for the first six months of their existence children
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>should derive their support entirely from their mother, and
that until they are a year or at least nine months old their
mother's milk should form the chief part of their food, yet
many circumstances may occur to render the full adoption of
this plan impracticable. In some women the supply of milk,
although at first abundant, yet in the course of a few weeks
undergoes so considerable a diminution as to become altogether
insufficient for the child's support; while in other cases,
although its quantity continues undiminished, yet from some
defect in its quality it does not furnish the infant with proper
nutriment. Cases of the former kind are not unusual in young,
tolerably healthy, but not robust women; while instances of the
latter are met with chiefly among those who have given birth
to several children, whose health is bad, or among the poor,
who have been enfeebled by hard living or hard work. The
children in the former case thrive well enough for the first six
weeks or two months, but then, obtaining the milk in too small
a quantity to meet the demands of their rapid growth, they
pine and fret, they lose both flesh and strength, and, unless the
food given to supply their wants be judiciously selected, their
stomach and bowels become disordered, and nutrition, instead
of being aided, is more seriously impaired. In the case of the
mother whose milk disagrees with the child from some defect
in its quality, the signs are in general more pronounced.
Either the infant vomits more than that small quantity which a
babe who has sucked greedily or overmuch often rejects immediately
on leaving the breast, or it is purged, or it seems
never satisfied, does not gain flesh, does not thrive, cries much
and is not happy. In these cases, too, the mother's supply of
milk, though abundant at first, diminishes in a few weeks; she
feels exhausted, and suffers from back-ache, or from pain in
the breasts each time after the child's sucking; while, further,
her general weakness leaves her no alternative but to wean the
child.</p>

<p>Knowing the attempt to rear her child entirely at the breast
to be vain, the mother may in such cases be tempted to bring
it up by hand from the very first. But how short soever the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>period may be during which the mother may be able to suckle
her child, it is very desirable that she should nurse it during
that period, and also that her milk should then constitute its
only food. For the first four or five days after the infant's
birth the milk possesses peculiar qualities, and not merely
abounds in fatty and saccharine matter, but presents its casein
or curd in a form in which it is specially easy of digestion.
These peculiarities indeed become less marked within a week
or two; but not only is it of moment that the infant should at
any rate make its start in life with every advantage, but the
mother who nurses her little one even for a month avoids thereby
almost half the risks which follow her confinement. For the
indolent, among the wealthy, a numerous class who have but
to form a wish in order to have it gratified, a wet-nurse for the
baby suggests itself at once to the mother as a ready means of
saving herself trouble, and of shirking responsibility. This
course, to which love of pleasure and personal vanity tend alike
to prompt her, often finds, in spite of all opposing reasons,
the approval of the nurse, to whom it saves trouble, and the
too ready acquiescence of the doctor in a course which pleases
his patient. But many circumstances besides those moral
considerations, which ought never to be forgotten before the
determination is formed to employ a wet-nurse, may put this
expedient out of the question, and it becomes therefore of importance
to learn what is the best course for a mother to adopt
who is either wholly unable to suckle her child, or who can do
so only for a very short time.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the more nearly the substitute approaches
to the character of the mother's milk, the greater will be the
prospect of the attempt to rear the child upon it proving
successful. There is no argument needed to prove that the milk
of some animal more closely resembles the mother's milk, and
is more likely to prove a useful substitute for it than any kind
of farinaceous substance. The milk of all animals, however,
differs in many important respects from human milk, and
differs too very widely in different animals. Thus, the milk of
the cow and that of the ewe contain nearly double the quantity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>of curd, and that of the goat more than twice the quantity
of butter, and it is only in the milk of the ass that the solid
constituents are arranged in the same order as in man. On
this account, therefore, asses' milk is regarded, and with propriety,
as the best substitute for the child's natural food. Unfortunately,
however, expense is very frequently a bar to its
employment, and compels the use of the less easily digested
cows' milk. But though the cost may be a valid objection to
the permanent employment of asses' milk, it is yet very desirable
when a young infant cannot have the breast, that it
should be supplied with asses' milk for the first four or five
weeks, until the first dangers of the experiment of bringing it up
by hand have been surmounted. The deficiency of asses' milk
in butter may be corrected by the addition of about a twentieth
part of cream, and its disposition to act on the bowels may be
lessened by heating it to boiling point, not over the fire but in
a vessel of hot water; and still more effectually by the addition
to it of a fourth part of lime-water or of a teaspoonful of the
solution of saccharated carbonate of lime to two ounces or
four tablespoonfuls of the milk.</p>

<p>When cows' milk is given, it must be borne in mind that it
contains nearly twice as much curd, and about an eighth less
sugar, than human milk. It is therefore necessary that it should
be given in a diluted state and slightly sweetened. The dilution
must vary according to the infant's age; at first the milk
may be mixed with an equal quantity of water, but as the child
grows older the proportion of water may be reduced to one-third.
Mere dilution with water, however, leaves the proportion
of curd unaltered, and it is precisely the curd which the
infant is unable to digest. Instead, therefore, of diluting the
milk simply with water, it is often better to add one part of
whey to about two parts of milk, which, according to the
child's age, may or may not be previously diluted.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Attention must be paid to the temperature of the food
when given to the infant, which ought to be as nearly as possible
the same as that of the mother's milk, namely from 90&deg; to
95&deg; Fahrenheit, and in all cases in which care is needed a
thermometer should be employed in order to insure the food
being given at the same temperature. Human milk is alkaline,
and even if kept for a considerable time it shows little tendency
to become sour. The milk of animals when in perfect health
likewise presents an alkaline reaction, and that of cows when at
grass forms no exception to this rule. Milk even very slightly
acid is certain to disagree with an infant; it is therefore always
worth while the moment that a hand-fed infant seems ailing to
ascertain this point. If alkaline, the milk will deepen the blue
colour of litmus paper, which is to be had of any chemist; if
acid, it will discharge the colour and turn it red. It is, perhaps,
as well to add that, as the oxygen in the atmosphere tends to
redden litmus paper, it should not be left exposed to the air,
but should always be kept in a glass-stoppered bottle.</p>

<p>The milk of the cow is very liable to alteration from comparatively
slight causes, and particularly from changes in the
animal's diet; while even in the most favourable circumstances
if the animal is shut up in a city and stall-fed, all the solid constituents
of its milk suffer a remarkable diminution; while the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>secretion further has a great tendency to become acid, or to
undergo even more serious deterioration. Mere acidity of the
milk can be counteracted for the moment by the addition of lime-water,
or by stirring up with it a small quantity of prepared
chalk, which may be allowed to subside to the bottom of the
vessel; or if it should happen, though indeed that is rarely
the case in these circumstances, that the child is constipated,
carbonate of magnesia may be substituted for the chalk or
lime-water. If these simple proceedings are not sufficient to
restore the infant's health, it will be wise to seek at once for
another source of milk supply, and to place the suspected milk
in the hands of the medical officer of health or of the public
analyst, in order that it may be submitted to a thorough
chemical and microscopical examination.</p>

<p>The difficulty sometimes found in obtaining an unvaryingly
good milk supply, as well as practical convenience in many
respects, has led to the extensive employment of various forms
of condensed milk. They form undoubtedly the best substitute
for fresh cows' milk which we possess, and are a great boon
especially to the poor in large towns where the milk supply is
often scanty, not always fresh, and sometimes of bad quality.
I should certainly prefer condensed milk for an infant to milk
from cows living in close dirty stables, such as my experience
thirty years ago made me familiar with in some parts of London.</p>

<p>Still all the varieties of condensed milk are far inferior in
quality to good fresh milk. They contain less butter, less
albumen, that is to say less of the main constituents of all animal
solids and fluids, and a greater proportion of what are termed
the hydro-carbonates, such for instance as sugar; or, to state the
same thing differently, the elements which serve for nutrition are
in smaller proportion than in fresh milk to those which minister
to respiration. They are not only less nutritious, but the large
quantity of sugar which they contain not infrequently disagrees
with the child, and causes bowel complaint. I do not know
how far the so-called unsweetened condensed milk which has of
late come into the market is free from this objection; but I have
always preferred the Aylesbury condensed milk, which is manufactured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>with sugar, to the Swiss condensed milk, into which, as
I have been given to understand, honey largely enters.</p>

<p>How much food does an infant of a month old require?
what intervals should be allowed between each time of feeding?
and how should the food be given? are three questions which
call for a moment's notice. The attempt has been made to
determine the first point by two very distinguished French
physicians, who weighed the infants before and after each time
of sucking. Their observations, however, were not sufficiently
numerous to be decisive, and their results were very conflicting;
the one estimating the quantity at two pounds and a quarter
avoirdupois, which would be equivalent to nearly a quart, the
other at not quite half as much; but the observations of the latter
were made on exceptionally weak and sickly infants. Infants
no doubt vary, as do grown people, as to the quantity of food
they require. I should estimate from my own experience and
observation, apart from accurate data, a pint as the minimum
needed by an infant a month old; and while Dr. Frankland's
estimate of a pint and a half for an infant of five months
seems to me very reasonable, I should doubt its sufficing for
a child of nine months unless it were supplemented by other
food.</p>

<p>The infant during the first month of life takes food every
two hours, and even when asleep should not be allowed to pass
more than three hours; and this frequent need of food continues
until the age of two, sometimes even until three, months.
Afterwards, and until six months old, the child does not need to
be fed oftener than every three hours during the twelve waking
hours, and every four hours during the sleeping time. Later
on, five times in the twenty-four hours, namely thrice by day,
once the last thing at night, and once again in the early morning,
are best for the child's health as well as for the nurse's
comfort.</p>

<p>How is an infant not at the breast to be fed? Certainly
not with the cup or spoon; a child so fed has no choice in the
matter, but must either swallow or choke, and is fed as they
fatten turkeys for the market. The infant, on the other hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>sucks the bottle as it would suck its mother's breast; it rests
when fatigued, it stops to play, it leaves off when it has had
enough, and many a useful inference may be drawn by the
observant nurse or mother who watches the infant sucking, and
notices if the child sucks feebly, or leaves off panting from want
of breath, or stops in the midst, and cries because its mouth is
sore or its gums are tender.</p>

<p>But it is not every bottle which an infant should be fed
from, and least of all from those so much in vogue now with
the long elastic tube, so handy because they keep the baby
quiet, who will lie by the hour together with the end in its
mouth, sucking, or making as though it sucked, even when the
bottle is empty. These bottles, as well as the tubes connected
with them, are most difficult to keep clean; and so serious is
this evil, that many French physicians not only denounce their
use, in which they are perfectly justified, but prefer, to the use
of any bottle at all, the feeding the infant with a spoon; and
here I think they are mistaken. The old-fashioned flat bottle,
with an opening in the middle, and a short end to which the
nipple is attached without any tube, the only one known in
the time of our grandmothers, continues still the best, and very
good. My friend, Mr. Edmund Owen, in a lecture at which I
presided at the Health Exhibition in August last year, pointed
out very humorously the differences between the old bottle
and the new. An infant to be kept in health must not be
always sucking, but must be fed at regular intervals. The
careful nurse takes the infant on her knee, feeds it from the old-fashioned
feeding-bottle, regulating the flow of the milk
according as the infant sucks heartily or slowly, withdraws it
for a minute or two, and raises the child into a sitting posture
if it seems troubled with flatulence, and then after a pause
lets it recommence its meal. This occupies her a quarter of an
hour or twenty minutes of well-spent time, while the lazy nurse,
or the mother who has never given the matter a thought, just
puts the tube in the infant's mouth, and either takes no further
trouble or occupies herself with something else. And yet,
obvious though this is, how constantly one sees infants taken
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>about in the perambulator with the feeding-bottle wrapped up
and laid by its side, because it is said the child always cries
when it is not sucking, and the intelligence and the common
sense are wanting, as well as the patient love, that would strive
to make out which it is of many possible causes that makes the
infant cry. One more observation with reference to bottle-feeding
may not be out of place. It is this: that no food be
left in the bottle after the child has had its meal, but that it
should be emptied, washed out with a little warm water and
soda, and it and the india-rubber end should be kept in water
till again needed. To insure the most perfect cleanliness it is
always well to have two bottles in use, and to employ them
alternately.</p>

<p>How strictly soever an infant may be kept at the breast, or
however exactly the precautions on which I have insisted are
observed, sickness, constipation, or diarrh&oelig;a may occur, causing
much anxiety to the parents, and giving much trouble to the
doctor.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, without its being possible to assign
for it any sufficient reason, that the mother's milk disagrees
with her infant, or entirely fails to nourish it, so that, much
against her will, she is compelled to give up suckling it. In
some instances this is due to errors in diet, to the neglect of
those rules the observance of which is essential to health, as
proper exercise for instance; and then the secretion is usually
deficient in quantity as well as defective in its composition. In
such cases the child often vomits soon after sucking, it suffers
from stomach-ache, its motions are very sour, of the consistence
of putty, and either green, or become so soon after being
passed, instead of presenting the bright yellow colour and
semi-fluid consistence of the evacuations of the healthy infant,
and sometimes they are also lumpy from the presence of masses
of undigested curd. In addition, also, the child is troubled
with griping, which makes it cry; its breath is sour, or actually
offensive, and the tongue is much whiter than it should be,
though it must be remembered that the tongue of the sucking
child always has a very slight coating of whitish mucus, and is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>neither as red nor as perfectly free from all coating as it becomes
in the perfectly healthy child of three or four years
old.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the diminution of stimulants, such
as the stout of which young women are sometimes mistakenly
urged to take a quantity to which they were previously quite
unaccustomed, is often followed by an increase of the quantity
as well as an improvement in the quality of the milk. It is
true that a nursing mother may often find her strength maintained,
and her supply of milk increased, by taking a glass of
stout at lunch and another at dinner, instead of, but not in
addition to, any other stimulant; but mere stimulants will no
more enable a woman to suckle her infant better than she otherwise
would do, than they would fit a man to undergo great
fatigue for days together, or to go through a walking tour in
Switzerland. A tumbler of one-third milk and two-thirds good
grit gruel taken three times a day will have greater influence in
increasing the quantity of milk than any conceivable amount of
stimulant.</p>

<p>There is an entirely opposite condition in which the infant
does not thrive at the breast, and this for the most part is met
with when the mother has already given birth to and suckled
several children. In these instances the secretion is sometimes,
though not always, abundant, but the infant does not thrive
upon it. The babe does not get on, is always hungry after
leaving the breast, and cries as though it wanted more; in
addition to which it is often purged, either while sucking or
within a few minutes afterwards, though the motions, except
in being more frequent and more watery than in health, do not
by any means constantly show any other change. The mother's
history explains the rest. She is constantly languid, suffers
from back-ache, feels exhausted each time after the babe has
sucked, probably has neuralgia in her face, or abiding headache.
In many instances, too, her monthly periods return,
though as a rule they do not appear in healthy women while
suckling. All these symptoms show that her system is not
equal to the duty she has undertaken, and that therefore, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>her sake as well as for that of the infant, she must give up the
attempt.</p>

<p>One more case there is in which suckling has to be given
up, at any rate in part, and that is when the milk is good in
kind, but insufficient in quantity for the child as it grows older.
This insufficiency of quantity shows itself at different periods
after the infant's birth&mdash;at two months, three, or four. The
child is not otherwise ill than that it is no longer bright, as it
was wont to be, it ceases to gain flesh, it sleeps more than it
used to do, though when it wakes it is always eager for the
breast, and cries when leaving it, and if the experiment is made
of giving it some milk and water immediately on leaving it, it
takes that greedily. Mothers are loth to believe this failure of
their resources, and in the case of some who have firm and well-formed
breasts, there is but little change in their appearance
to show that what remains may serve for beauty, not for use.
But if while the child is sucking, the nipple is taken suddenly
from its mouth, instead of innumerable little jets of milk,
spirting out from the openings of the milk-ducts, the nipple
will be seen to be barely moistened by its languid flow.</p>

<p>In conditions such as these the question of weaning partially
or completely inevitably occurs, and where the mother's weakness
is the occasion of the failure to nourish the child, half-measures
are of no avail, for so long as she does not entirely
give up the attempt to do that to which her health is unequal, her
own state will grow worse, that of the child will not improve.
When errors of diet or inattention to general rules of health
incapacitate the mother from the performance of her duty,
there may be hope from the adoption of a wiser course; while
when the supply simply fails from its inadequacy, much may
be hoped for from a wise combination of hand-feeding with
nursing at the breast; the mother perhaps suckling the infant
by day, but being undisturbed by demands upon her at night.</p>

<p>Last of all, I must refer to cases in which love has been
stronger than reason, as indeed it often is, and in which young
people with some pronounced hereditary taint of scrofula or
consumption marry and have children. In such cases, if the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>consumptive taint is on the mother's side, it is, I believe, much
wiser, in the inability to obtain a good wet-nurse, to bring up
the child by hand rather than at the mother's breast. One
word, however, applicable in such circumstances, age and long
experience entitle me to add, and it is this. It is essential that,
in the absence of that guarantee against the too rapid succession
of pregnancies which suckling for a reasonable time presents,
there should be self-restraint on both sides, lest the inscription
on the young wife's grave should be, as I have too often known
it, the same as, in despite of poetry and romance, her biographer
assigns as the cause of the death of Petrarch's Laura, that she
died worn out <i>crebris partubus</i>, by too many babies.</p>

<p>In all of these cases the rules which I have already given
with reference to hand-feeding have to be borne in mind: the
preference for asses' milk at first, the careful regulation of the
amount of curd in the cows' milk afterwards, increased or
diminished by the greater or less proportion of whey mixed
with it. Sometimes, however much the quantity of curd or
casein may be reduced, the child is yet unable to digest it,
for it is firm and not easily acted on by the juices of the
stomach. It is then best to omit it altogether, and to supply
the necessary albumen by white of egg. A very good food in
these circumstances is made of&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">White of one raw egg,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Quarter of an ounce of sugar of milk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three teaspoonfuls of cream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Half a pint of whey.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks, or when the child seems to need
stronger nourishment, one part of veal-tea, made with a pound of
veal to a pint of water, may be added to one part of whey, with
the white of egg and sugar of milk as before, and one part of
white decoction, as it was called some two centuries ago in
England. It is composed of&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Half an ounce of hartshorn shavings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Inside of one French roll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three pints of water&mdash;boiled to two, strained and sweetened.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>This forms an extremely useful way of introducing farinaceous
food into the infant's diet, and preparing the way for
a larger amount of it which by degrees becomes necessary. Of
these, one of the most generally useful is Liebig's or Savory and
Moore's food for infants, which has the advantage of not constipating
as so many other farinaceous foods do. Chapman's
Entire Wheat Flour is an extremely good food; and wheat, as you
will remember, excels other farinaceous substances in its nutritive
properties, but it is not so easy of digestion as Liebig. There is,
however, scarcely any kind of farinaceous food, among which
Nestl&eacute;'s must not be forgotten, which may not answer for an
infant; provided always that at first it is not given oftener than
twice a day, that it is not made too thick, nor given in larger
proportion than one-third of the farinaceous food to two-thirds
of the whey, milk, or whatever it is mixed with; and besides,
whatever the food may be, it should be prepared each time
afresh.</p>

<p>This is not the place for going into all details on the subject
of feeding infants, or to explain how if wisely managed the
child weans itself by degrees from the bottle or the breast&mdash;the
best way, be it said, of weaning&mdash;or how by degrees it
comes to its daily midday meal of beef-tea and bread, and
then, when the first grinding teeth have been cut, to a small
meat meal daily, finely minced or scraped, and so little by
little adopts the modes of living of its elders.</p>

<p>But, last of all, there are instances, though not so many as
the public imagine, in which the infant, in spite of most judicious
management, fails to thrive, and suffers from various disorders
of its digestion.</p>

<p>The most unmanageable and the least hopeful of these
cases are those in which the infant is the subject of consumptive
disease. It is very rare for its symptoms, even in
cases of the most marked tendency to consumption on the part
of the parents, to show themselves before the age of three
months, and I think I may add, that apart from such tendency
consumption never appears in infancy or early childhood, except
when it follows on some acute illness, such as inflammation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>of the lungs, or on typhoid, or, as it is commonly called,
remittent fever.</p>

<p>Consumption of the bowels, as it is popularly termed, may
be said never to occur in early infancy apart from consumptive
disease of the lungs, and is then always accompanied by an increase
towards evening of the temperature from its natural
standard of 98.5&deg; to 100&deg;. Hence the absence of cough and
the persistence of a natural temperature may be taken as
almost conclusive evidence that there is no consumptive disease
of the bowels. Consumptive disease in infancy is invariably
attended with glandular enlargement. The glands of the
bowels when irritated always communicate their irritation to
the glands in the groin and the bend of the thigh, which are
felt hard and enlarged, like little peas, under the finger. But
further, if there is real disease of the glands of the bowels,
other tiny enlarged glands will be felt, like shot, under the skin
of the belly, from which in the general progress of emaciation
the layer of fat always present in the healthy baby will already
have been removed. Besides this, too, the veins running
beneath the skin there, invisible in the healthy infant, will be
seen meandering like blue lines, and telling the story that more
blood than usual flows through them, because the diseased
glands inside interfere with its ready passage through its proper
channels.</p>

<p>Two cautions, however, have to be borne in mind with
reference to both of these indications of disease. The first
is, that the glands in the groin may be enlarged from mere
irritation, independent of actual disease communicated to them
from the glands inside. If, however, you find the glands at the
corner of the lower jaw and those on either side of the neck
enlarged too, you are then driven to the conclusion that the
glands in the groin are enlarged not from mere local irritation,
but from general disease, and that consumption is its cause.</p>

<p>Again, the superficial veins of the belly may be enlarged
from any cause which interferes with the proper circulation
through the vessels inside. Hence they are often enlarged in
grown people in dropsy, and hence too in infants and young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>children from flatulent distension of the bowels. But in this
case the other signs of consumption are wanting; the emaciation,
the cough, the increase of evening temperature, and the
enlargement of the glands, are all absent.</p>

<p>Sometimes we meet with instances where the child does
not digest its food, does not thrive, does not gain flesh, never
passes healthy evacuations, at length wastes, loses strength,
and dies, without having had any of the signs which I have
pointed out as indicative of consumptive disease, and in fact
without having suffered from it. Now, these cases are connected
with imperfect performance of the function of the liver,
and sometimes with an imperfection of its structure. Before
birth the functions of the liver are not called into action in
the same way nor to the same degree as afterwards, and its
structure differs in this respect that it contains a larger amount
of fat and a smaller proportion of bile-secreting cells than
afterwards. It sometimes happens from causes which we do
not understand that the liver structure not only does not
undergo that higher development which should take place,
but that the fat cells increase at the expense of the bile cells.
In these circumstances the food is ill-digested and the health
is much impaired, and at last wasting takes place to as great a
degree as in the case of consumption, only there are no cough,
no glandular enlargement, no big superficial veins, no increased
temperature, while on a careful examination the doctor will
seldom fail to find the rounded edge of the enlarged liver
coming lower down than natural. In these cases too there is
a disposition to convulsive affections, and to that peculiar form
of convulsion called spasmodic croup, concerning which I shall
have something to say later on.</p>

<p>In its less serious form this is both a more frequent and a
less grave condition than consumption, and its existence explains
to a great degree those cases in which young children
have failed to be nourished by the milk food which commonly
suits their tender age, but have improved on beef-tea, raw meat
or its juice, and food entirely destitute of saccharine matter.</p>

<p>In cases where there is reason to apprehend consumptive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>disease, the skill and resources of the doctor will often be
heavily taxed to meet each difficulty as it arises. A good wet-nurse,
or, in default of her, asses' milk, with the addition of
cream to supply the butter in which the asses' milk is deficient,
a couple of teaspoonfuls of raw meat juice in the course of
every twenty-four hours, much care in the introduction of
farinaceous substances into the diet, and cod-liver oil twice a
day, beginning with ten drops and gradually increasing the
dose to a teaspoonful, are all that the mother herself can do.
When the cod-liver oil is not borne by the stomach, or when&mdash;which,
however, is not often the case&mdash;the child refuses to take
it, glycerine may be substituted for it, though it must be owned
that it is a very poor and inefficient substitute. The inunction
of cod-liver oil is in any case not to be had recourse
to; it makes the child unpleasant to itself and loathsome to
others, while the power of the skin to absorb oily matters is
far too limited to be worth taking into account.</p>

<p>Vomiting, though by no means a prominent symptom of
either of the two very grave conditions of which I have
been speaking just now, is yet a very common attendant on
all disorders of digestion in early life. It is indeed much
more frequent in the infant than in the adult, and the greater
irritability of the stomach continues even after the first few
months of existence are past, and does not completely cease
during the early years of childhood. In every case of vomiting
in childhood, therefore, the first question to set at rest is
whether it depends on disorder of the digestive system, or
whether it heralds the onset of one of the eruptive fevers, or
of inflammation of the chest, or of affection of the brain; and
in determining this all the directions given when I was speaking
of the general symptoms of disease are to be carefully studied.
Vomiting often accompanies infantile diarrh&oelig;a, even when the
food taken cannot be regarded as its occasion; and now and
then the stomach, with no obvious exciting cause, suddenly
becomes too irritable to retain any food, and this indeed may
be the case even though attended by few or no other indications
of intestinal disorder. The child in such cases seems still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>anxious for the breast; but so great is the irritability of the
stomach that the milk is either thrown up unchanged immediately
after it has been swallowed, or it is retained only for a
few minutes, and is then rejected in a curdled state; while
each application of the child to the breast is followed by the
same result. It will generally be found, when this accident
takes place in the previously healthy child of a healthy mother,
that it has been occasioned by some act of indiscretion on the
part of its mother or nurse. She perhaps has been absent
from her nursling longer than usual, and returning tired from
a long walk or from some fatiguing occupation, has at once
offered it the breast, and allowed it to suck abundantly; or the
infant has been roused from sleep before its customary hour,
or it has been over-excited or over-wearied at play, or in hot
weather has been carried about in the sun without proper protection
from its rays.</p>

<p>The infant in whom from any of these causes vomiting
has come on, must at once be taken from the breast, and for
a couple of hours neither food nor medicine should be given
to it. It may then be offered a teaspoonful of cold water;
and should the stomach retain this, one or two spoonfuls may
be given in the course of the next half-hour. If this is not
rejected, a little isinglass may be dissolved in the water,
which must still be given by a teaspoonful at a time, frequently
repeated; or cold barley-water may be given in the same manner.
In eight or ten hours, if no return of vomiting takes
place, the experiment may be tried of giving the child its
mother's milk, or cows' milk diluted with water, in small quantities
from a teaspoon. If the food thus given does not occasion
sickness, the infant may in from twelve to twenty-four
hours be restored to the breast: with the precaution, however,
of allowing it to suck only very small quantities at a time, lest,
the stomach being overloaded, the vomiting should again be
produced.</p>

<p>In many instances when the sickness has arisen from some
accidental cause, such as those above referred to, the adoption
of these precautions will suffice to restore the child's health.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>If, however, other signs of disorder of the stomach or bowels
have preceded the sickness, or are associated with it, medicine
cannot be wholly dispensed with, and the advice of the doctor
must be sought for. Very likely in addition to directing
the rules above laid down to be attended to, he may lay
a tiny dose of calomel, as a quarter, half or a whole grain
on the tongue, which often has a wonderful influence in
arresting sickness; while he may further put a small poultice
not much bigger than a crown piece, made half of mustard,
half of flour, on the pit of the stomach for a few minutes, and
may give the child a little saline, with a grain or two of
carbonate of soda, and perhaps a drop of prussic acid. These,
however, are not remedies to be employed by the mother, but
must be prescribed, and their effect watched by the medical
attendant.</p>

<p>Sickness, indeed, is not always a solitary symptom unattended
by other evidences of disordered digestion, but is
sometimes associated with signs of its general impairment, and
this may be so serious as to lead to great loss of flesh, and even
to end in endangering life. In many instances, however, the
child does not lose much flesh though it digests ill, and its
symptoms would be troublesome rather than alarming, if it
were not that they are often the signs of an unhealthy constitution,
out of which in the course of a few months consumption
is not infrequently developed. Long-continued
indigestion in the infant always warrants anxiety on the part of
the parent.</p>

<p>In some of these cases there is complete loss of appetite,
the infant caring neither for the breast nor for any other food.
It loses the look of health and grows pale and languid, though
it may not have any special disorder either of the stomach or
of the bowels. It sucks but seldom and is soon satisfied, and
even of the small quantity taken, a portion is often regurgitated
almost immediately. This state of things is sometimes brought
on by a mother's over-anxious care, who, fearful of her infant
taking cold, keeps it in a room too hot or too imperfectly
ventilated. It follows, also, in delicate infants on attacks of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>catarrh or of diarrh&oelig;a, but it is then for the most part a passing
evil which time will cure. In the majority of cases, however,
the loss of appetite is associated with evidence of the stomach's
inability to digest even the small quantity of food taken, and
the bowels are irregular in their action, as well as unhealthy in
their secretion. Loss of appetite, too, though a frequent is by
no means a constant attendant on infantile indigestion, but
is replaced sometimes by an unnatural craving, in which the
child never seems so comfortable as when sucking. It sucks
much, but the milk evidently does not sit well upon the
stomach; for soon after sucking, the child begins to cry and
appears to be in much pain until it has vomited. The rejection
of the milk is followed by immediate relief; but at the same
time by the desire for more food, and the child often can be
pacified only by allowing it to suck again. In other cases
vomiting is of much less frequent occurrence, and there is
neither craving desire for food, nor much pain after sucking;
but the infant is distressed by frequent acid or offensive
eructations; its breath has a sour or nauseous smell, and its
evacuations have a most f&oelig;tid odour. The condition of the
bowels that exists in connection with these different forms of
indigestion is variable. In cases of simple loss of appetite,
the debility of the stomach is participated in by the intestines,
and constipation is of frequent occurrence, though the evacuations
do not always appear unhealthy. In other instances in
which the desire for food still continues, the bowels may act
with due regularity, but the motions may have a very unnatural
appearance. If the child is brought up entirely at the breast,
the motions are usually liquid, of a very pale yellow colour,
often extremely offensive, and contain shreds of curdled milk,
which not having been digested within the stomach, pass unchanged
through the whole track of the bowels. In many
instances, however, the infant having been observed not to
thrive at the breast, arrowroot or other farinaceous food is given
to it, which the stomach is wholly unable to digest, and which
gives to the motions the appearance of putty or pipe-clay,
besmeared more or less abundantly with slime or mucus. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>evacuations are often parti-coloured, and sometimes one or two
unhealthy motions are followed by others which appear perfectly
natural; while attacks of diarrh&oelig;a often come on, and
the matters discharged are then watery, of a dark dirty green
colour, and exceedingly offensive.</p>

<p>Children, like grown persons suffering from indigestion,
often continue, as I have already said, to keep up their flesh
much better than could be expected, and in many cases grow
up to be strong and healthy. Still the condition is one that
not merely entails much suffering on the infant, but by its continuance
seriously impairs the health, and tends to develop the
seeds of any constitutional predisposition to consumptive
disease.</p>

<p>In these cases there are many respects in which the mother
can most efficiently second the doctor. All causes unfavourable
to health must be examined into, and as far as possible removed.
It must be seen that the nursery is well ventilated, and that its
temperature is not too high; while it will often be found that
no remedy is half so efficacious as change of air. Next, it
must not be forgotten that the regurgitation of the food is due
in great measure to the weakness and consequent irritability of
the stomach, and care must therefore be taken not to overload
it. If these two points are attended to, benefit may then be
looked for from the employment of tonics, and as the general
health improves the constipated condition of the bowels, so
usual in these cases, will by degrees disappear; while if
aperients are needed those simple remedies only should be
employed of which I spoke in the first part of this book, and
the use of mercurials is not to be resorted to without distinct
medical order.</p>

<p>The above mode of treatment is appropriate to cases of
what may be termed the indigestion of debility, but a different
plan must be adopted in those instances in which it depends
on some other cause. The rule, indeed, which limits the
quantity of food to be given at one time is no less applicable
here, for the rejection of some of the milk may be the result of
nothing more than of an effort which nature makes to reduce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>the work that the stomach has to do within the powers of that
organ. But when, notwithstanding that due attention is paid
to this important point, uneasiness is always produced by
taking food, and is not relieved till after the lapse of some
twenty minutes, when vomiting takes place, or when the infant
suffers much from flatulence and from frequent acid or nauseous
eructations, it is clear that the symptoms are due to something
more than the mere feebleness of the system.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the mere fact that the child vomits its
food, or of the milk so vomited being rejected in a coagulated
state, which proves that the stomach is disordered, but it is the
fact of firmly coagulated milk being rejected with much pain,
and after the lapse of a considerable interval from the time of
its being taken, which warrants this conclusion. The coagulation
of the curd is the first change which the milk of any
animal undergoes when introduced into the stomach. The
coagulum of human milk is soft and flocculent, and not so
thoroughly separated from the other elements of the fluid, as
the firm hard coagulum or curd of cow's milk becomes from
the whey in which it floats. In a state of health the abundantly
secreted gastric juice speedily redissolves the chief part of the
curd in the stomach, while when it has passed into the intestine
the alkaline bile which there becomes mixed with it, completes
its solution, and converts the whole into a fluid which
closely resembles one of the chief elements of the blood, is
consequently very easily taken up by the minute vessels whose
office it is to do so, and thus supplies with nourishment the
whole body.</p>

<p>Milk tends, however, to undergo changes spontaneously,
which produce its coagulation, and the occurrence of these
changes is greatly favoured by a moderately high temperature,
such as that which exists in the stomach. But the alterations
of the fluid that accompany this spontaneous coagulation are
very different from those which are brought about by the vital
processes of digestion. An acid becomes formed within it,
and the acid thus produced has none of the solvent power of
gastric juice, but by its presence impedes rather than favours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>digestion. Every nurse is aware that a very slight acidity of the
milk will suffice to give an infant vomiting, stomach ache, and
diarrh&oelig;a, and the result must be much the same whether
fermentation had begun in the milk before it was swallowed, or
whether it commences afterwards, in consequence of the disordered
condition of the stomach, and the absence of a healthy
secretion of gastric juice.</p>

<p>The nature of the food is the first point that requires attention
in the management of these cases of infantile dyspepsia.
If the child had been fed on cow's milk the symptoms may be
due to the gastric juice not having been able to dissolve the
curd, which you will remember is much firmer than that of
human milk as well as twice as abundant. In this case the
substitution of asses' milk, the employing whey either entirely
or in part instead of milk, and the adding white of egg in order
to present the elements of the curd in a more easily digestible
form, may all be tried with advantage. Sometimes children
refuse whey; and then a mixture of cream and veal broth, more
or less diluted either with water or with the white decoction,
may be given instead. The addition of soda, potash, chalk or
lime water to milk before it is given is also of service, since it
not only prevents the occurrence of fermentation, but also
renders the curd of cow's milk more easily soluble.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate and over-free employment of these
alkalies, however, as nursery remedies is by all means to be
avoided, for the symptoms of indigestion for which a grown
person if suffering would seek the advice of a skilful doctor
require his help no less when the patient is a child. When
acids will be of service in promoting the secretion of the gastric
juice, when pepsine will be likely to be of use, when stimulants
such as a little brandy, when aromatics to get rid of flatulence,
opiates to relieve pain or check diarrh&oelig;a, or when an occasional
mercurial, or some other remedy may be of use by
stimulating the liver to increased action, are questions which I
would not advise any mother to try to answer for herself.
Much care and pains and knowledge and experience are often
required by the doctor to enable him to answer them correctly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>I must not leave the consideration of the ailments of the
digestive organs in early infancy without some notice of that
affection of the mouth popularly known as <i>thrush</i> to which an
exaggerated importance was once attached as the supposed
cause of those symptoms of disordered health, of which it is
in reality only the accompaniment. Still it is a sign of such
grave disorder that it needs a careful study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thrush.</span>&mdash;If you examine the mouth of a young infant, in
whom the attempt at hand-feeding is not turning out well, you
will often observe its lining to be beset with numerous small
white spots, that look like little bits of curd lying upon its surface,
but which on a more attentive examination are found to
be so firmly adherent to it as not to be removed without some
difficulty, when they leave the surface beneath it a deep red
colour, and now and then bleeding slightly. These specks
appear upon the inner surface of the lips, especially near the
angles of the mouth, on the inside of the cheeks, and upon
the tongue, where they are more numerous at the tip and edges
than towards the centre. They are likewise seen upon the gums,
though less frequently and in smaller numbers. When they
first appear they are usually of a circular form, scarcely larger
than a small pin's head; but after having existed for a day or two,
some of the spots become three or four times as large, while at
the same time they in general lose something of their circular
form. By degrees the small white crusts fall off of their own
accord, leaving the surface where they were seated redder than
before; a colour which gradually subsides, as with the infant's
improved health the mouth returns to its natural condition. If
the improvement is tardy the white specks may be reproduced
and again detached several times before the mouth resumes its
healthy aspect. In the worst cases the specks coalesce, and
coat the mouth as though lined with a membrane which is
usually of a yellowish-white tint instead of having the dead
white colour of the separate spots. Even here, however,
though the surface is very red, it scarcely bleeds if the deposit
is removed from it gently and with care.</p>

<p>The popular notion that when the deposit of thrush appears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>not only in the mouth, but also at the edge of the bowel, it has
passed through the child is altogether erroneous. The lining
membrane of the bowel indeed is red, inflamed, and presents
those conditions to which I have already referred when speaking
of the atrophy of hand-fed children, but the actual deposit of
thrush can take place only where there exists an appropriate
structure for its formation, and that is to be found, not in the
bowels, but only at the inlets and outlets of the digestive canal.
The actual deposit at the outlet of the bowel is indeed exceptional,
though the edges are often red and sore from the irritation
produced by the acrid motions, and this irritation sometimes
extends to the skin over the lower part of the baby's person,
which becomes rough, and covered with a blush of redness.</p>

<p>Thrush in the child is of far less serious import than in the
grown person. In the latter it indicates the existence of some
very serious, almost hopeless disease, and hence it is that we
meet with it in the last stages of dysentery, cancer, and consumption.
In the child a slight attack of thrush may occur
from causes which are by no means serious, and may disappear
under the use of simple means, such as I have already described
when speaking of the troubles of digestion in early infancy.</p>

<p>While in any case it must rest with the doctor to regulate
as he best knows how the constitutional treatment of the condition
on which the thrush depends, it must be for the mother
to see that appropriate local measures are adopted. One point
of considerable moment, and to which less care than it deserves
is usually paid, is the removing from the mouth, each time after
the infant has been fed, of all remains of the milk or other
food. For this purpose whenever the least sign of thrush appears,
the mouth should be carefully wiped out with a piece of soft
rag dipped in a little warm water every time after food has
been given. Supposing the attack to be but slight this precaution
will of itself suffice in many instances to remove all
traces of the affection in two or three days. If, however, there
is much redness of the mouth, or if the specks of thrush are
numerous, some medicated application is desirable.</p>

<p>The once popular honey and borax is not the best application,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>and this for a reason which I will at once explain. The
secretion of the mouth in infants is acid, disease increases this
acidity; and it has been found that this acid state is not
merely favourable to the increase of thrush, but also to the
development between the specks of thrush of a sort of membrane
formed by a peculiar microscopic growth, of whose
existence, just as of that of the phylloxera which destroys the
vine, or the muscardine which kills the silkworm, we were
ignorant till brought to light by recent scientific research.</p>

<p>You will therefore at once see why saccharine substances,
apt as they are to pass into a state of fermentation, are not
suitable, and why it is better to employ a solution of&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Borax, twenty grains</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Glycerine, one teaspoonful</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Water, an ounce.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Now and then the use once or twice a day in addition of a
very weak solution of caustic, as two grains of lunar caustic to
an ounce of water, in bad cases is necessary; but of this it
must be left to the doctor to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teething.</span>&mdash;The transition is a very natural one by which
we pass from the study of the dangers and difficulties which
attend the feeding and rearing of young infants, to those which
accompany <i>teething</i>.</p>

<p>The time of teething is looked forward to by most mothers
with undisguised apprehension, nurses attribute to it the most
varied forms of constitutional disturbance, and doctors constantly
hold forth to anxious parents the expectation that their
child will have better health when it has cut all its teeth. The
time of teething, too, is in reality one of more than ordinary
peril,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> though why it should be so is not always rightly understood.
It is a time of most active development, a time of
transition from one mode of being to another, in respect of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>those important functions by whose due performance the body
is nourished and built up.</p>

<p>The error which has been committed with reference to this
matter, consists not in overrating the hazard of the time, when
changes so important are being accomplished, but in regarding
only one of the manifestations&mdash;though that indeed is the most
striking one of the many important ends which nature is then
labouring to bring about. A child in perfect health usually
cuts its teeth at a certain time and in a certain order, just as a
girl at a certain age begins to show signs of approaching womanhood;
and at length attains it with but slight inconvenience
or discomfort. The two processes, however, have this in
common, that during both, constitutional disturbance is more
common, and serious diseases are more frequent than at other
times, and the cause in both lies far deeper than the outward
manifestation.</p>

<p>The great changes which nature is constantly bringing
about around us and within us are the result of laws operating
silently but unceasingly; and hence it is that in her works
we see little of the failure which often disappoints human endeavours,
or of the dangers which often attend on their accomplishment.
Thus when her object is to render the child no
longer dependent on the mother for its food, she begins to
prepare for this long beforehand. The first indication of it is
furnished by the greatly increased activity of the salivary
glands, which during the first few months of existence have
scarcely begun to perform their function, a fact which accounts
for the tendency to dryness of the tongue of the young infant
under the influence of very trivial ailments. About the fourth or
fifth month, this condition undergoes a marked alteration; the
mouth is now found continually full of saliva, and the child is
constantly drivelling; but no other indication appears of the
approach of the teeth to the surface, except that the ridge of
the gums sometimes becomes broader than it was before. No
further change may take place for many weeks; and it is
generally near the end of the seventh month before the first
teeth make their appearance. The middle cutting teeth of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>lower jaw are in most instances the first to pierce the gum; next
the middle cutting teeth of the upper jaw; then usually the
side cutting teeth of the lower jaw, and lastly, the corresponding
ones of the upper. This, however, is not quite invariable,
for sometimes all the cutting teeth in one jaw precede in their
appearance any of those in the other. The first four grinding
teeth next succeed, and often without any very definite order
as to whether those of the upper or of the lower jaw are first
visible, though in the majority of instances the lower are the
first to appear. The four eye teeth follow, and lastly, the remaining
four grinding teeth, which complete the set of first, or
as they are often called, milk teeth.</p>

<p>We must not, however, picture to ourselves this process as
going on uninterruptedly until completed&mdash;a mistake into which
parents often fall, whose anxiety respecting their children is excited
by observing that after several teeth have appeared in rapid
succession, the process appears to come to a standstill. Nature
has so ordered it that teething which begins at the seventh or
eighth month, shall not be completed until the twenty-fourth
or thirtieth; and has doubtless done so in some measure with
the view of diminishing the risk of constitutional disturbance
that might be incurred if the evolution of the teeth went on
without a pause. As a rule the two lower central incisors or
cutting teeth make their appearance in the course of a week;
six weeks or two months often intervene before the central
upper incisors pierce the gum, but they are in general quickly
followed by the lateral incisors. A pause of three or four
months most frequently occurs before we see the first grinding
teeth, another of equal length previous to the appearance of
the eye teeth, and then another still longer before the last
grinding teeth are cut.</p>

<p>Though a perfectly natural process, teething is almost
always attended with some degree of suffering. This, however,
is not always the case, for sometimes we discover that an infant
has cut a tooth, who yet had shown no signs of discomfort,
nor any indication that teething was commencing, with the exception
of an increased flow of saliva. More frequently indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>the mouth becomes hot, and the gums look tumid, tense, and
shining, while the exact position of each tooth is marked, for
some time before its appearance, by the prominence of the gum;
or the eruption of the teeth is preceded by much redness, and
great heat of the mouth with profuse flow of saliva, and even with
little painful ulcers of the edge of the tongue, or of the inner
surface of either lip. With either of these conditions the child
is feverish, fretful, and cries from time to time with pain, while
at the same time the bowels often are relaxed, or the child
coughs and wheezes as if it had caught cold.</p>

<p>Symptoms such as these make up what nurses mean when
they say that the child is suffering from its teeth, and this
opinion is constantly followed by a request to the doctor to
lance the baby's gums. Now this little operation when really
called for often gives great relief, both to the local discomfort,
and also to the general ailment from which the infant
suffers, but it is often done when there is no occasion for it,
and when consequently it causes needless pain, and does no
good.</p>

<p>There are four different conditions in which it may be right
to have the child's gums lanced:</p>

<p>First. When a tooth is very near the surface, and by cutting
through the thin gum the child may be spared some
needless suffering.</p>

<p>Second. When the gums are very red and hot and swollen;
only in this case the gum is scratched or cut, to bleed it, not
with the idea of letting out the imprisoned tooth.</p>

<p>Third. When the child has for some week or two been
feverish and suffering; while, though the gum is tense and
swollen, the tooth does not seem to advance.</p>

<p>Fourth. As an experiment, when during the progress of
teething a child is suddenly seized with convulsions for which
there is no obvious cause. The irritation of the teeth may
have to do with their occurrence; and the chance of relieving
it by so simple a means is not to be thrown away.</p>

<p>If the process of teething is going on quite naturally, no
interference, medical or other, is either necessary or proper.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>The special liability of children to illness at this time must
indeed be borne in mind, and care must be taken not to make
any alteration in the infant's food while it is actually cutting its
teeth, but rather to choose the opportunity of some one of
those pauses to which reference has been made, as occurring
between the dates of appearance of the successive teeth, for
making any such change. If the child is feverish, a little soda
or seltzer water sweetened and given after the effervescence has
subsided will be taken eagerly, and avoid the risk of putting
the child too often to the breast, or giving it food too frequently.
It seeks the one or the other because it is thirsty, and craves
for moisture to relieve its hot mouth; not because it is hungry
and needs nourishment. If the child has been weaned, still
greater care will be required, for it will often be found that it is
no longer able to digest its ordinary food, which either is at
once rejected by the stomach, or else passes through the intestines
undigested. Very thin arrowroot made with water, with
the addition of one third of milk, will suit in many cases, or
equal parts of milk and water with isinglass, or equal parts of
milk and the white decoction. The bowels of course must be
kept open with very simple and mild aperients, but the bowels
are in general more inclined to diarrh&oelig;a than to constipation,
and the diarrh&oelig;a of teething children is often troublesome and
requires good medical advice.</p>

<p>The ulcerated state of the mouth is usually connected with
special disorder of the digestive organs, and that condition of
acidity for which I have already recommended soda, magnesia,
and similar remedies, while locally the mouth needs just that
local care which is applicable in cases of thrush. Now and
then, severe inflammation of the gums occurs, in which they
become extremely swollen; and ulceration takes place of the
gum just above where the tooth should come through, and
even around some of those which have already appeared. These
are cases in which lancing the gums would do nothing but
mischief. They require the local care already insisted on, a
mild plan of diet, and treatment to reduce any feverishness;
and above all one medicine, the chlorate of potass, which in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>doses of four grains every four hours for a child a year old, is
almost a specific.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Affections of the Skin</span>.&mdash;There are a few affections of
the skin to which children in early infancy are especially liable,
concerning which a few words must be said.</p>

<p>The Latin word <i>intertrigo</i> is used for that <i>chafing</i> of the
skin of the lower part of the body of an infant which is by no
means unusual, and is often very distressing. It is almost
invariably due to want of care. Either wetted napkins are
dried, and put on again without previous rinsing in water, or
they have been washed in water containing soda, and not
passed through pure water afterwards, or attention is not paid
to change the infant's napkin immediately that it requires; or
a fresh napkin is put on without previous careful ablution of
the child; or lastly it occurs almost unavoidably in cases of
diarrh&oelig;a from the extension of irritation beginning at the
edge of the bowel.</p>

<p>Care is usually all that is needed to remove, as it is to prevent
this condition. The precautions which I have referred to
with regard to cleanliness must be carefully observed, and
moreover, each time even after passing water, the child should
be carefully washed with thin gruel, or barley water, then dusted
abundantly with starch powder, while the napkin must be
thickly greased with zinc ointment. After the first six or seven
months of life the napkin can be almost always dispensed with,
if the child has been brought up in good habits, and in all
cases of chafing, it is much the better way to put no napkin on
the child when in bed, but to lay under it a folded towel,
which can be removed, and a clean one substituted for it as
soon as it becomes soiled.</p>

<p>There is a very obstinate form of chafing, with great redness
of the skin, and disposition to crack about the edge of the
bowel which depends on constitutional causes, and calls at
once for the interference of the doctor.</p>

<p>Besides this purely local ailment, there is another skin
affection which is seen over the body generally, and is known
popularly by the name of <i>red gum</i>, or in Latin <i>strophulus</i>. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>mention the Latin name because I have known persons sometimes,
misled by the similarity of sound, fancy that it had
some connection with scrofula. It is met with less commonly
now than formerly, when people were accustomed to keep
infants unduly wrapped up, and to be less careful than most
are now-a-days about washing and bathing. It depends on
over-irritation of the sweat glands of the delicate skin of the
infant, the result of which shows itself in the eruption on the
body and face of a number of small dry pimples sometimes
surrounded by a little redness, itching considerably, and when
their top has been rubbed off by scratching having a little
speck of dried blood at their summit.</p>

<p>A rash like this, a sort of <i>nettle rash</i>, more blotchy and
causing little lumps on the skin, which in a day or two come
and go, sometimes appears in the intervals between the pimples,
sometimes takes their place, and causes, as they do, much irritation.
This nettle rash is usually dependent on some error of diet, on
some acidity of the stomach, and, on their being corrected soon
passes away, leaving the pimples as they were before, but
sometimes being reproduced if the pimples cause excessive
irritation of the tender skin.</p>

<p>The matter of chief importance for a mother to know, is
that these rashes have no serious signification. Their treatment
is very simple. It consists in dressing the child very lightly,
in bathing it very frequently with tepid water, avoiding as far
as may be the use of soap, and in sponging it often to relieve
the irritation with some simple alkaline lotion; such for instance
as one recommended by the late Dr. Tilbury Fox, and which
is composed of twenty grains of carbonate of soda, two teaspoonfuls
of glycerine, and six ounces of rose water. Of course
if the stomach is out of order that must be attended to, but a
little fluid magnesia, once or twice a day, is all that is usually
needed in the way of medicine.</p>

<p>One other affection of the skin, very common, very distressing,
very tedious, of which there are many varieties, generally known
by the technical name of <i>eczema</i>, from a compound
Greek word which signifies to flow, needs that I should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>say something about it. It is not limited in its occurrence to
infancy, nor does it of necessity cease when childhood is over,
but continues to recur even in grown persons, and shows itself
still from time to time even in the aged.</p>

<p>For the most part, however, it makes its appearance between
the fifth and twelfth month; sometimes seeming to be induced
by the change of food when the child is weaned, and that even
though the weaning may have been wisely managed; at other
times showing itself when the irritation of teething begins, and
in every instance being aggravated by the approach of each
tooth to the surface, and abating in the intervals.</p>

<p>It does not occur in all children with equal frequency or
severity, and though there is no doubt but that it is often
hereditary, and this especially in families some members of
which have suffered from gout, yet it is by no means unusual
for two or three of the children of the same parents to be
affected by it severely, while no trace of it appears in the
others.</p>

<p>It shows itself in general first on the cheeks and sides of
the face, where the skin becomes red and rough, and slightly
puffy. On looking very closely&mdash;more closely indeed than
most persons are wont to do&mdash;this appearance will be seen to
be produced by innumerable small pimples, smaller than pins'
heads, and which itch violently. Now and then, even in the
course of a few hours, these pimples disappear, leaving the skin
rough, and peeling off in branny scales, while the surface beneath
is red and irritable, a condition which also in a few days may
subside. This, however, is less frequent than the opposite
course of the affection, in which a drop of fluid forms at the
top of each tiny pimple, and escaping forms a yellowish, thin,
transparent, watery, irritating discharge, which reddens still
more the raw and weeping surface of the skin. The fluid when
abundant dries at length into yellowish flakes or crusts, which
sometimes assume a brownish colour if the surface is made to
bleed by irritating or scratching. If the crusts are not removed,
the fluid which still continues to be poured out beneath them
soon changes into matter or <i>pus</i> as it is called, and this, shut up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>beneath the hard crust above, increases the irritation, and
thickens the deposit. After a time the inflammation lessens of
its own accord, the secretion diminishes, the crusts dry up, and
at length fall off, leaving the skin red, slightly swollen, and its
surface scaling off in flakes, which gradually cease to form, and
the skin by degrees becomes quite sound again, and so remains,
until perhaps the irritation caused by the approach of a new
tooth to the surface, rekindles the old trouble, to go once
again through the same stages as before.</p>

<p>It is on the cheeks, the sides of the face, and the top of the
head that these changes may be best studied, but there are other
situations in which the same kind of process often goes on. It
may be seen in the creases of the neck, or the folds of the thigh
in fat children, only as two surfaces of skin are there in contact
the fluid never dries to a crust, but the skin, red and sore and
swollen, pours out an abundant secretion which, just as when
it occurs behind the ears, gives out a strong and offensive smell.
It occurs, too, at the bends of the joints, as under the knee,
and at the inside of the elbow joint, as well as on the front of
the chest, the back, and sometimes even over the whole body,
and especially at any part where the pressure of the dress
irritates the skin. When thus general, it seldom fails to pass
into a chronic state such as to call for constant, skilled medical
treatment.</p>

<p>The attack often comes on with general feverishness, a hot
skin, fretfulness, and restlessness, which subside when the skin
begins to discharge, though the discomfort produced by the
local irritation still continues. At other times, and this perhaps
more often when the eruption first appears on the head, its onset
is more gradual, and slight scurfiness and redness at the top
of the head are first noticed, and then a little crust forms there
which is firmly adherent, and is, therefore, often not entirely
removed as it should be, and thus bit by bit the mischief extends
until its cure becomes tedious and troublesome. When
either from neglect, or from the ailment having set in acutely,
the affection of the scalp is severe, the child's state is one of
much suffering. The whole of the scalp becomes hot and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>swollen, and covered over a large surface by a thick dirty crust,
through cracks in which a thick ill-smelling greenish-yellow
matter exudes on pressure. At different points around,
pimples form with mattery heads,&mdash;pustules they are called&mdash;while
the glands on each side of the neck become swollen and
tender. When thus severe on the head it will be found also
not merely on the face, but also on the body, and the poor
suffering child is not only a miserable object to look upon, but,
worn by constant restlessness, it loses flesh, and seems almost
as though it could not long survive. Happily, however, the
condition scarcely ever terminates fatally, though feeble health
and stunted growth are not seldom the results of the early
suffering. But besides, severe eczema in infancy always returns
again and again in childhood and in after-life, and there is
also a distinct connection between liability to eczema and to
asthma; and this not simply nor mainly that the disappearance
of an attack of eczema may be succeeded by an attack of asthma,
but that the child who in infancy has had severe general eczema
is more prone than another to develop a disposition to asthma
as he attains the age of five or six, and this even though he should
not have had any return of the skin affection in a severe form.</p>

<p>It is evident then, that one cannot take too much pains to
guard against the occurrence of eczema if possible, and at any
rate to prevent its becoming severe. The disposition to it is
often controlled by very simple precautions, such as bathing
the face, the moment the skin shows any redness or roughness,
with thin gruel or barley water, then powdering it with starch
powder, and when the infant goes out, smearing the spot very
lightly with benzoated zinc ointment, and making the child wear
a veil. It will be observed that the exclusion of the air is in
all these cases the object of the application far more than any
specific virtue which it is supposed to possess, and many of the
worst cases of eczema in grown persons are treated, in the great
hospital for skin diseases in Paris, by an india-rubber mask, or
by india-rubber covering of the affected part, and benefit
thereby without any medicated application whatever. The
thin layer of scurf which often forms on an infant's head should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>not be allowed to remain there, since its presence is a source
of irritation. If it is very adherent, the surface may be well
greased overnight with a little clarified lard which will soften it,
so that it can be readily washed off with weak soap and water
in the morning. If, however, the skin is very irritable soap
must not be used, but the head must be washed with yelk of
egg and warm water, and instead of a sponge, which would be
too harsh, it is better to employ a very large camel's hair brush
or a soft shaving brush, which is more handy, and the surface
after careful drying may be lightly smeared with zinc ointment.
All ointments used must be washed off most scrupulously every
day, otherwise they become rancid, irritate, and make matters
worse.</p>

<p>When eczema sets in acutely, with general feverish disturbance,
cooling medicines are required, and the help of the
doctor becomes necessary. These are the cases in which the
eruption is not confined to the head or the face, but extends
over the body generally. The child must be dressed as loosely
as possible; and when in its cot, should lie there with no other
covering than its little shirt; and nothing gives so much relief
to the irritation as the abundant use of powder, either simple
starch powder, or ten parts of starch powder to one of oxide of
zinc, or carbonate of bismuth. All powders must be absolutely
free from grit, or, in other words, quite impalpable;
otherwise they irritate the surface. On the face and other
parts where it can be employed, the puff may be used to apply
the powder; but between the creases of the skin&mdash;which it is
important to keep apart&mdash;fine linen, lint, or charpie must be
employed, covered freely with powder, so as to prevent the
surfaces from coming into contact. If the irritation is very
distressing, a weak spirit lotion with a little carbolic acid
may sometimes be sponged over the surface, and the powder
renewed immediately; or other forms of soothing lotions may
be used to abate the irritation.</p>

<p>When the scalp is affected in the acute form of eczema
crusts form very quickly; or in other cases they collect because
people fear to disturb them when they see the raw surface
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>beneath. It is, however, a grievous mistake to allow them to
collect; they are in themselves a source of irritation, and they
entirely prevent any application reaching the skin beneath.
They must always be removed, and never be allowed to form
again. They can be removed either by the employment of a
poultice, half of bread, half of linseed meal, or by the application
over-night of a handkerchief soaked in sweet oil, and
covered over with a piece of oiled silk, which softens the
crusts effectually, and allows of their easy removal by abundant
washing with weak soap and water.</p>

<p>The best applications afterwards vary so much that it is
impossible to lay down any positive rule. Sometimes the
Carron oil, as it is termed: a liniment compound of equal parts
of linseed oil and lime-water&mdash;a popular and most useful application
in burns&mdash;gives most ease to the irritated skin; sometimes
the mere exclusion of the air by means of the india-rubber
cap; sometimes the abundant use of powder. In every
case, at least once in every twenty-four hours the whole surface
must be washed quite clean with barley water or thin gruel;
and when the discharge lessens or ceases, as it will do in the
course of time, then, but not till then, various ointments may
be of service.</p>

<p>When the chronic stage arrives, in which the skin becomes
dry and scaly, then is the time for tonics, for iron, sometimes
for cod-liver oil, and for arsenic; of which latter remedy, however,
the results are uncertain; while in the acute stage, its
influence is simply mischievous. Nothing is more difficult,
nor calls for more skill, or larger medical experience, than the
proper management of the various forms of chronic eczema.</p>

<p>The question is sometimes asked whether it is safe to cure,
or, as people call it, to dry up these eruptions in teething
children. There can be no doubt but that it is very desirable
to prevent their occurrence as far as may be by the use of the
precautionary measures which I have explained. But when
they have existed for some time, either attended with profuse
discharge, or causing great irritation by their extent, there is no
doubt but that care must be exercised in attempts at their cure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>that soothing measures such as I have advocated should be
chiefly employed, and that the sudden drying up of the discharge
by a too abundant use of dusting powders must be
avoided. If, too, the diminution of the rash were followed by
a worsening of the child's condition, by feverishness, by heaviness
of the head, or any sign of disturbance of the brain, the
attempt to cure the rash must at once be abandoned. At the
same time I must add that such occurrences are very rare, and
that for one case where I have had to regret my success in
curing the rash, I have seen fifty in which I have been mortified
by the failure of my endeavour.</p>

to whom I am indebted for the suggestion, are as follows: 'One-third of
a pint of new milk is allowed to stand until the cream has settled; the
latter is removed, and to the blue milk thus obtained about a square inch
of rennet is to be added, and the milk vessel placed in warm water.' (I
may add that the artificial rennet sold by most chemists may be substituted
for the other.) 'In about five minutes the rennet, which may again be
repeatedly used, being removed, the whey is carefully poured off, and immediately
heated to boiling to prevent its becoming sour. A further quantity of

<h3><i>ON THE DISORDERS AND DISEASES INCIDENT
TO ALL PERIODS OF CHILDHOOD.</i></h3>


<p>The ailments hitherto noticed are by no means all that may
occur during infancy and early childhood, but those only which
either happen then exclusively, or at least with far greater
frequency than at other times.</p>

<p>It will be most convenient to consider the others under the
different systems to which they belong, as diseases of the head,
of the chest, and of the bowels.</p>

<p>Before entering on these new subjects, however, a few words
may not be out of place with reference to what may be termed
the second period of childhood. It is above all a time of
wonderfully lessened sickness and mortality. We have not the
means of stating exactly the rate at which mortality is lessened
between the cessation of the first and the commencement of
the second dentition; but we do know that it is ten times less
between the age of one and five, and nearly twenty times less
between five and ten than it was in the first year of existence.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
A mother's anxiety then may safely be quieted after the first
year of her infant's life, and still more after the first set of teeth
have been cut, for if her child is strong and healthy then, there
will be comparatively little to fear for its future.</p>

<p>Four years or thereabouts now follow, before any important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>change takes place in the child's condition, for it is not until
between six and seven years old that the first set of teeth begin
to be shed, and the second to take their place. This change
of teeth too is of far less moment as far as the health is concerned,
than was the cutting of the first set. The first dentition
was the preparation for an entirely new mode of life for the child,
and was intended to fit it for a life independent of its mother.
The second has no such signification; it is a mere local
alteration rendered necessary by the growth of the jaws, and
takes place quietly, by the gradual absorption of the roots of
the first set of teeth, brought about by the pressure of the others
as they approach the surface. Four teeth in each jaw are new,
and replace no others, but usually they are cut without much
discomfort, and the wisdom teeth do not concern us here, for
they do not appear until childhood has long passed.</p>

<p>But, though between the age of two years and of ten there
is no important change, nor even preparation for a change in
the constitution, the time is yet one of most active growth of
the body, and consolidation of the skeleton. The stature
increases from 2 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. 6 in., and the weight nearly
doubles, while at the same time the ends of the long bones
previously connected with the shafts by means of cartilage or
gristle, become firmly united by the conversion of that cartilage
into bone, and a similar process goes on, though not
completed till later, in the ribs and the breast bone.</p>

<p>Rapid increase of height and weight; conversion of the
elements of bone into bone itself, formation of muscle out of
the fat, which in the young child was stored up as so much
building material for an edifice in course of construction, require
for their accomplishment perfect health, and the power of converting
to its highest purposes all the nourishment received.
What wonder then, if from time to time, the machinery thus
hardly taxed, fails to be quite equal to the demands upon
it, if pains in the limbs&mdash;growing pains, as they are commonly
called, or head-ache, tell of the inadequate nerve supply. Or
if from the same cause, a vague feverish condition comes on,
in which the temperature is slightly raised, and the child
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>listless, and yet fretful, loses its cheerfulness, is dull at its easy
tasks, and yet indifferent to play. This too is the time when
any unsuspected defects, physical, or mental, or moral, begin
to show themselves distinctly; when short sight becomes
apparent so soon as the child has to learn its letters, when the
dull hearing is perceived which makes it seem inattentive, and
gives to its manner an unchildlike nervousness; and the weak
intellect is displayed in causeless laughter, causeless mischief,
causeless passion, imperfect power of articulation, or want of
words, and by a restless busyness in doing nothing.</p>

<p>Of all these things I shall have to speak later on more fully.
They are the things however, which only those mothers notice
who live much with their children, who do not banish them all
day long to the nursery or the school-room, and learn from
another whether they fare well or ill. They and only they
will notice these things in whom there dwells that which the
poet tells us of:</p>

<h3>THE DISORDERS AND DISEASES OF THE BRAIN AND
NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h3>


<p>It is stated on good authority<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> that more than half of the
deaths at all ages from these causes take place in children
under five years, a fact which at first sight seems as inexplicable
as it is startling. There is, however, a twofold explanation of
it: the circulation through the much softer tissue of the brain,
unenclosed within a <i>firm bony case</i> as in after-life, varies with
far greater rapidity in the infant than in the grown person, and
hence the organ is far more easily overfilled with or emptied
of its blood. Besides, any organ in which growth is going on
with great rapidity is proportionately liable to become disordered
or diseased. Now the brain doubles its weight in the
first two years of life, and attains nearly its full size by the end
of the seventh year.</p>

<p>These two facts suggest a bright as well as a dark view of
disorders of the brain and nervous system in early life. If
disorder is more frequent, it is excited by slighter causes, is
more likely to be temporary, and even its gravest symptoms,
such as convulsions and paralysis, have a less serious import
in the one case than in the others. If the grown man has a
fit, and still more, if that fit is followed by paralysis, we fear
and with reason that some vessel in the brain-substance has
given way, or that some grave, probably irreparable damage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>has been inflicted on it. In the child, and especially in the
young infant, these accidents may mean nothing more than
that the brain has suddenly become over-filled with blood, or
that it has been disturbed by irritation&mdash;I know of no better
term&mdash;in some distant organ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Convulsions.</span>&mdash;There are in the body two great nerve
masses, the brain and the spinal cord, through which all parts are
brought into relation with each other. The spinal cord or spinal
marrow receives impressions from all parts, imparts movement
to the limbs, as well as gives activity to the functions of the various
internal organs. The brain is the controlling power, and
governs more or less consciously the movements which the
spinal cord originates, and hence in proportion as the development
of the brain advances, and its controlling power increases,
those involuntary movements, fits or convulsions, which originate
in irritation of the spinal cord, become rarer. The brain,
at the age of three years, is more than twice as large as in the
first year of life, and deaths from convulsions have then sunk
to a third of their former frequency; while from the age of ten
to fifteen years, when the brain may be said to be perfected,
only four per cent., instead of nearly eighty per cent. as in the
first years of life, of all deaths from disorders of the nervous
system are due to convulsions.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I dwell on this subject the more because there is in a fit of
<i>convulsions</i> something so intensely painful to behold that it is
easy to exaggerate its danger, and to lose all presence of mind
in panic. First, then, it is well to bear in mind that real disease
of the brain rarely, very rarely, I do not say never, begins with
convulsions; and next, that their real danger is in general in
exactly opposite relation to the frequency of their occurrence.
Convulsions now and then return thirty, forty, or more times
in twenty-four hours, and continue to do so sometimes for
three or four days together. They are, indeed, not without
peril, for the perpetually returning disturbance of the circulation
may give rise to an overfilling of the vessels of the brain, or to
a stagnation of the blood within them, or the spasm may affect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>the muscles which open and close the entrance to the windpipe,
and the child may die choked as in a paroxysm of whooping
cough, or in a fit of spasmodic croup, or lastly the violent and
frequently repeated muscular movements may at length exhaust
its feeble frame. But still, such frequently recurring
convulsions are in themselves no evidence that the brain is
diseased; they do but show that the irritability of the spinal
cord is increased to a degree which the brain is no longer able
to control, and which therefore manifests itself in violent convulsive
movements.</p>

<p>It is thus that the poison of scarlet fever or of small-pox
sometimes displays its influence over the whole system by producing
violent convulsions at the outset of those diseases; thus
that they follow on some indigestible article of food, or that
the mother, over-heated by violent exertion, or overwhelmed
by the news of some unexpected calamity, sees her babe, to
whom she is in the act of giving the breast, suddenly seized by
a violent convulsion.</p>

<p>In every instance, therefore, the first business is to ascertain
the cause of the convulsion, to determine the seat of the irritation
which has excited the nervous system to such tumultuous
reaction. The convulsion which ushers in any one of the
eruptive fevers in the infant or in the child, is only an exaggeration
of the shivering which precedes the onset of fever
in the adult. Has the child been exposed to the contagion of
measles, small-pox, or scarlatina? is it teething, and if so, when
did its last tooth appear? of what did its last meal consist?
when were its bowels last open? has it been exposed to the
sun with its head uncovered? or has it, though in the shade,
been sitting or playing out of doors in the intense heat of a
summer's day? has it had a fall, or been frightened? or is it
suffering from whooping-cough which has of late been very
severe? or has its breathing been accompanied with a peculiar
catch or crow, the sign of spasmodic croup, and have at the
same time its hands been usually half clenched, and the thumb
shut into the palm, the sign of that disturbance which at length
has culminated in an attack of convulsions? Such are the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>questions, which in less time than it takes me to write, or others
to read, the intelligent mother will put to herself, and will
answer, instead of, in unreasoning alarm, giving all up as lost, or
hastening without reflection to do something or other that
were better left undone.</p>

<p>The first thing to do in every case of convulsions, be their
cause what it may, is to loosen the dress, so that no string nor
band may interfere with respiration, and for this purpose strings
must be cut and dresses torn. The next thing is to dash cold
water on the face to induce a deep inspiration, for sudden death
in a fit almost always takes place from interruption to breathing.
With the same purpose the forefinger should be put into the
mouth, and run rapidly to the root of the tongue, which should
be drawn forward. The object of doing this is twofold; first,
to prevent the tongue falling back, as in these circumstances it
is apt to do, over the entrance of the windpipe and so producing
suffocation, and in the next place the act very frequently puts
an end to the spasmodic closure of the windpipe, and is followed
by a deep-drawn breath which announces the infant's
safety. If the child has cut any teeth, the handle of a spoon,
round which a bit of rag has been wrapped, or a bit of wood,
or a thin strip of india-rubber, should be put between the teeth
as far back as possible to prevent the tongue being bitten; and
often this is all that can be done.</p>

<p>There are two circumstances, and two only, in which the
warm bath is likely to be of use. At the onset of one of the
eruptive fevers, a hot bath is sometimes of great service by
stimulating the skin and thus bringing out the rash. In these
cases the fit scarcely ever comes on in a child previously in
perfect health, but for some hours at least it has appeared very
ill, tossing about with great restlessness, with a dry, hot skin,
and twitching of the tendons of the wrists; or, perhaps, with
a pale face and cold hands and feet, but with the temperature
of the body as high as 103&deg; or 105&deg;. Here the hot bath at
96&deg; to 98&deg;, even rendered more stimulating by the addition
of mustard, and continued for not more than five minutes,
is sometimes of great service, and is speedily followed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>the cessation of the convulsions and the outbreak of the
eruption.</p>

<p>These, too, are the cases in which the use of the wet sheet,
as practised in hydropathic institutions, is sometimes of great
benefit, but I do not advise its employment except under
medical advice.</p>

<p>The second condition in which the bath, and here it is the
tepid and not the hot bath&mdash;that is to say, the bath at from 87&deg; to
90&deg;&mdash;is of service, is where the child is feverish and restless from
over-fatigue or over-excitement, or from exposure to the sun or
to an excessively hot atmosphere, and convulsions have come
on in the course of this ailing. Here the tepid bath for ten
or fifteen minutes, coupled with the application of cold to the
head, will soothe the excitement and prevent the return of the
convulsions.</p>

<p>In neither this case, nor in that in which the hot bath is
employed, is the result of the agent as magical as people sometimes
seem to expect. It is rarely that convulsions cease while
a child is actually in the bath. For the most part the influence
of the bath is limited to abating their severity, shortening their
duration, and indisposing to their return.</p>

<p>The bath, then, is to be used when either a stimulating or
a soothing influence on the surface is likely to be of service,
and only then. In cases where the fits are produced by constipation,
by improper food, or by the irritation of a tooth
pressing against the gum, it is idle to use it, and equally so in
instances where many fits have been recurring in the course of
the same day. Where that is the case it must be self-evident
that, be the cause what it may, it must be one over which either
a hot or a tepid bath can have no influence, and that, painful
as it must be to wait a passive spectator, that position is far
wiser than that of a mischievous meddler. It is some consolation,
also, to know that unconsciousness to suffering attends
convulsions.</p>

<p>There is one agent, chloroform, which often has a very
remarkable influence in controlling frequently repeated convulsions.
It is an agent, however, too hazardous to be trusted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>out of medical hands, and even when the doctor administers it
himself, the parents must fully recognise the fact that, inasmuch
as the child may die during a fit quite independently of breathing
chloroform, so the occurrence of that catastrophe during its
employment is not to be made a subject of self-reproach to
them, or of blame to the doctor.</p>

<p>But you may ask whether there are no <i>signs</i> of that disturbance
of the nervous system, by which you can judge beforehand
that the occurrence of convulsions is probable. In proportion
to the tender age of a babe, the greater is the probability,
as I have already stated, that convulsions will be induced by
slight causes, especially by such as digestive troubles. Unless
you are aware of the phraseology that used at any rate to be
common among nurses, you may be much alarmed at being
told that the child who had seemed scarcely unwell has been
very much convulsed, when all that is meant is that the child
has shown some of the signs that threaten convulsions&mdash;has
had, in short, what in the time of our grandmothers used to be
called <i>inward fits</i>. A child thus affected lies as though it were
asleep, winks its imperfectly closed eyes, and gently twitches
the muscles of its face&mdash;a movement especially observable
about the lips, which are drawn as though into a smile. Sometimes,
too, this movement of the mouth is seen during sleep,
and poets have told us that it is the angels' whisper which
makes the babe to smile&mdash;I am sorry that its meaning in plain
prose should be so different. If this condition increases, the
child breathes with difficulty, its respiration sometimes seems
for a moment almost stopped, and a livid ring surrounds the
mouth. At every little noise the child wakes up; it makes a
gentle moaning, brings up the milk while sleeping, or often
passes a great quantity of wind, especially if the stomach is
gently rubbed. When the disorder of the digestion, on whatever
cause it depended, is removed, these symptoms speedily
subside, nor is there much reason to fear general convulsions
so long as no more serious symptoms show themselves. There
is more cause for apprehension, however, when the thumbs are
drawn into the palm, either habitually or during sleep; when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>the eyes are never more than half-closed during sleep; when
the twitching of the muscles is no longer confined to the angles
of the mouth, but affects the face and extremities; when the
child awakes with a sudden start, its face growing flushed or
livid, its eyes turning up under the upper eyelid, or the pupils
suddenly dilating, while the countenance wears an expression
of great anxiety or alarm, and the child either utters a shriek,
or sometimes begins to cry.</p>

<p>When a fit comes on, the muscles of the face twitch, the
body is stiff, immovable, and then in a short time, in a state of
twitching motion, the head and neck are drawn backwards
and the limbs violently bent and stretched. Sometimes these
movements are confined to certain muscles or are limited to
one side, and I may add that such cases are of more importance
as far as the state of the brain is concerned than those in
which the convulsions are general. The eye is fixed and does
not see; the fingers may be passed over it without its winking,
the pupil is immovably contracted or dilated; the ear is insensible
even to loud sounds, the pulse is small, very frequent,
often too small, and too frequent even for the skilled doctor
to count it; the breathing hurried, laboured and irregular;
the skin bathed in abundant perspiration.</p>

<p>After this condition has lasted for a minute, or ten minutes,
or an hour or more, the convulsions cease; and the child
either falls asleep, or lies for a short time as if it were bewildered,
or bursts out crying, and then returns to its senses,
or sinks into a state of stupor, in which it may either be perfectly
motionless, or twitching of some muscles may still continue;
or, lastly, it may, though this seldom happens, die in
the fit.</p>

<p>It seems then, from all that has been said, that convulsions,
though one of the most striking, are by no means one of the
most conclusive signs of brain disease; that they are even more
commonly the result of disorders of the nervous system from
causes seated elsewhere, than of actual disease of what may be
termed the great nervous centre.</p>

<p>We may now therefore pass to the examination of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>diseases, which for the purposes of this book may be considered
under the two heads of congestion and inflammation.</p>

<p>I am forced to use these terms in somewhat of a popular
sense, for to attempt in a little book like this to define everything
with strict scientific accuracy would simply confuse and
mislead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Congestion of the Brain.</span>&mdash;By <i>congestion of the brain</i>
is meant a condition in which its vessels are overcharged with
blood; a condition which if it exists in an aggravated degree,
ends either in the pouring out of blood on, or into the brain,
on the one hand, or in inflammation on the other. Either of
these terminations, however, is so rare in the previous healthy
child, that I shall confine my remarks entirely to congestion
of the brain, an affection specially liable to occur in children
during teething. A certain degree of feverishness almost
always accompanies teething. It is, therefore, not difficult to
understand how, when the circulation is in a state of permanent
excitement, a very slight cause may suffice to overturn
its equilibrium, and occasion a greater flow of blood to the
brain than the organ is able to bear. Congestion of the brain,
however, is not by any means limited to this season, but may
occur at other times without any obvious exciting cause,
and with no other explanation than is furnished by the well-known
fact that all periods of development such as childhood,
are periods during which the growing organs are most
apt to become disordered.</p>

<p>In the great majority of cases the symptoms of congestion
of the brain come on slowly; and for the most part, general
uneasiness, or disordered state of the bowels, which are usually,
though not invariably constipated, and feverishness precede for
a few days the more serious attack. The head by degrees becomes
hot, the child grows restless and fretful, and seems distressed
by light, or noise, or sudden motion, and children who
are old enough sometimes complain of their head. Usually
too, vomiting occurs repeatedly; a symptom of the greatest importance,
since it may exist before there is any well-marked
sign of head affection. Causeless frequently repeated vomiting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>in a child not ill but ailing, is nine times out of ten a sign of
mischief in the head. The degree of fever which attends
this condition varies much, and its returns are irregular; but any
one who knows how to feel the pulse will find it permanently
quickened, and if the head is unclosed the pulsations of the
brain may be seen and felt distinctly. The sleep is disturbed,
the child often waking with a start, while there is occasional
twitching of the muscles of its face, or of the tendons of its
wrist.</p>

<p>The child may continue in this condition for many days
and then recover its health without any medical interference.
This is especially likely to be the case with children while
teething, the fever subsiding, the head growing cool, and the
little one appearing quite well so soon as the tooth has cut
through the gum, but the approach of each tooth to the
surface being attended by the recurrence of the same
symptoms.</p>

<p>The fortunate issue of these cases though frequent, is by no
means invariable, for sometimes they are but the precursors of
that formidable, I might indeed say, all but hopeless disease,
water on the brain. But even of itself congestion of the brain
is by no means a trivial ailment, for it may pass into a stage in
which the smaller discomforts of the child lead to the sad
mistake that the condition of the child is improving, instead of
which it is really the dulling of sensibility from approaching
death. The head, indeed, becomes less hot, the flush of the face
grows slighter and less constant; but the countenance is heavy
and anxious, the indifference to surrounding objects increases,
and the child lies in a state of torpor or drowsiness, from which
indeed it can at first be roused to complete consciousness
The manner on being roused is always fretful, but, if old
enough to talk, the child's answers are natural, though generally
very short; and murmuring, 'I am so sleepy, so sleepy,'
it subsides into its former drowsiness. The bowels generally
continue constipated, and the vomiting seldom ceases, though
it is sometimes less frequent than before. In this state, without
any apparent cause, the child sometimes has an attack of convulsions,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>which subsiding, leaves the torpor deeper than before.
The fits return, and death may take place in one of them, or
the torpor growing more profound after each convulsive seizure,
the child at length dies insensible.</p>

<p>Now and then, especially in infants of only five or six months
old, recovery takes place even where there seemed almost
no ground for hope. The overfull vessels have at length relieved
themselves, fluid has been poured out into the cavities of
the brain, the yielding skull has given way under the pressure
from within, and should the child after all survive, its large head,
due to chronic water on the brain, tells to all who know how to
interpret the signs, the tale of its past illness, and the manner
of its imperfect recovery.</p>

<p>Cases such as these are obviously beyond the reach of
domestic management, and call for all the resources of medical
skill. The mistake commonly made is that of calling in the
doctor too late, because it is not realised how grave may be the
import of symptoms which at first appear so little alarming;
and the so-called experienced nurse having said, 'Oh! it's
nothing but the baby's teeth,' time is lost and danger not anticipated
till too late for remedy.</p>

<p>The application of two, three, or four leeches at the very
outset of these cases is often of great service, and sometimes
cuts short symptoms which had seemed very threatening.
The doctor, of course, must be the judge of its expediency, but
I refer to it because I have known parents raise objections to it,
and beg to have milder means tried first. It must be borne in
mind then, that whenever leeches are of use it is at the beginning
of an attack, and that the opportunity once let slip does
not return. Purgatives, cold to the head, saline medicines,
and perhaps some carefully selected sedative, are the measures
which will probably be employed in most cases, but success will
in great measure depend on the minute care with which all
the details which I dwelt on in the introduction, are carried
out.</p>

<p>It is not always, indeed, that active treatment is desirable,
and gentle measures then suffice; but nothing except close and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>frequent watching can enable the doctor to steer safely between
the two opposite dangers of too little and too much.</p>

<p>When I come to speak of the eruptive fevers, I shall have to
mention the convulsions and other signs of most serious brain disturbance,
which sometimes occur at their outset, and which are
due to the condition of the blood charged with the fever poison.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar set of symptoms, attributed with reason
to the overheated state of the blood, occurs in cases of <i>sunstroke</i>.
It is true that sunstroke, with the formidable characters that it
presents in hot countries, is not seen in England, but even here
the mere exposure of an infant or young child to an overheated
atmosphere, is by no means unattended with risk, and I refer to
it here, because mothers are by no means aware of the danger,
and believe that it suffices to guard the child from the direct
rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Alarm, restlessness, and fretfulness, alternating with drowsiness,
hurried, irregular breathing, intense heat of skin, violent
beating of the open part of the head, twitching of the limbs, and
starting of the tendons of the wrists, with a pulse too rapid to
be counted, are the symptoms when the attack is severe. Convulsions
are rare, though they sometimes occur. Sickness is
almost invariable, the stomach rejecting everything, and the
bowels are almost invariably relaxed, severe diarrh&oelig;a or dysentery
sometimes coming on, as the brain disturbance abates.
The first shock may kill the child in a few hours, or it may sink
under the subsequent diarrh&oelig;a, but as a rule recovery eventually
takes place.</p>

<p>All cases, indeed, are not equally severe, but all require
careful and gentle treatment, the cool and darkened room, the
quiet, the cold to the head, the tepid bath, and on the part of
everyone the care not to allow the apparently serious condition
of the child to urge them to those active measures which will
here be out of place, and destroy the hopes which would revive
after a few hours of patience and gentle means.</p>

<p>Really acute inflammation of the brain is of so rare occurrence
except as the result of accident or injury, and its symptoms
are of so serious a character, even from the first, that medical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>advice is obviously needed at once. I shall, therefore, pass it
over here, and endeavour to describe two forms of inflammation
of the brain which are much more frequent, and at their commencement
more likely to be overlooked.</p>

<p><b>Water on the Brain.</b>&mdash;One of these is the form of inflammation
commonly known as <i>water on the brain</i>, a term which,
though incorrect medically, has the advantage of being well
understood. This, now, is not a simple disease, occurring in a
previously healthy child, but it is a disease dependent on the
same state of constitution as gives rise in other children to
consumption, or scrofula, or disease of the mesenteric glands.</p>

<p>It is this circumstance which renders the disease so serious,
and recovery from it so extremely rare. This it is also which
makes it so desirable to become acquainted with its symptoms,
both that you may be alive to the approach of danger, and also
not indulge in needless alarm when brain symptoms occur from
other causes which have no relation whatever to those which
give rise to water on the brain.</p>

<p>The disease comparatively seldom comes on in a child who
had previously seemed in perfect health; a state of vague ailing
usually precedes its outbreak. The child loses flesh and
strength, and the look of health, and the lustre of the eye, and
the silky softness of the hair. The appetite becomes uncertain,
the bowels irregular, with a tendency to constipation; there
are little feverish attacks for a few hours, subsiding of their
own accord. The sleep is not sound, the temper uncertain,
the child tires even of its favourite toys; the brightness of the
little face is changed for a strange, weird, wistful look&mdash;an
unnatural earnestness; the child sits for moments gazing
upward on vacancy, as though it saw, or sought something
beyond.</p>

<p>By degrees these vague premonitions, which may continue
for weeks, become more and more marked till they pass into
what may be called the first stage of the affection, in which
there are signs of congestion of the brain, such as I have
already described, coupled with general irregular attacks of
feverishness. The child becomes more gloomy, more pettish,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>and slower in its movements, and is little pleased by its usual
amusements. Or, at other times, its spirits are very variable;
it will sometimes cease suddenly in the midst of its play, and
run to hide its head in its mother's lap, putting its hands to its
head, and complaining of headache, or saying merely that it is
tired and sleepy, and wants to go to bed. Sometimes, too, it
will turn dizzy, as you will know, not so much from its complaint
of dizziness as from its suddenly standing still, gazing
around for a moment as if lost, and then either beginning to
cry at the strange sensation, or seeming to awake from a reverie,
and at once returning to its play. The infant in its nurse's
arms betrays the same sensation by a sudden look of alarm, a
momentary cry, and a hasty clinging to its nurse. If the child
can walk it may be observed to drag one leg, halting in its gait,
though but slightly, and seldom as much at one time as at
another, so that both the parents and the medical attendant
may be disposed to attribute it to an ungainly habit which the
child has contracted. The appetite is usually bad, though
sometimes very variable; and the child, when apparently busy
at play, may all at once throw down its toys and beg for food,
then refuse what is offered; or taking a hasty bite may seem to
nauseate the half-tasted morsel, may open its mouth, stretch
out its tongue, and heave as if about to vomit. The thirst
is seldom considerable, and sometimes there is an actual aversion
to drink as well as to food, apparently from its exciting
or increasing the sickness. The stomach, however, seldom
rejects everything; but the same food as occasions sickness at
one time is retained at another. Sometimes the child vomits
only after taking food, at other times, even when the stomach
is empty, it brings up some greenish phlegm without much
effort, and with no relief. These attacks of vomiting seldom
occur oftener than two or three times a day, but they may
return for several days together, the child's head probably growing
heavier, and its headache more severe. The bowels during
this time are disordered, generally constipated from the very
first, though their condition in this respect sometimes varies
at the commencement of the disease. The evacuations are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>usually scanty, sometimes pale, often of different colours, almost
always deficient in bile, frequently mud-coloured and very
offensive. The tongue is not dry, generally rather red at the
tip and edges, coated with white fur in the centre and yellowish
towards the root, but occasionally very moist, and uniformly
coated with white fur. The skin is harsh, but not very hot, the
temperature seldom above 100&deg; Fahr., varying causelessly, but
usually higher towards evening than in the daytime. The
nostrils are dry, the eyes lustreless, and <i>the child sheds no tears</i>.
It is drowsy, and will sometimes want to be put to bed two or
three times in a day; but it is restless, sleeps ill, grinds its
teeth in sleep, lies with its eyes partially open, awakes with the
slightest noise, or even starts up in alarm without any apparent
cause. At night, too, the existence of intolerance of light is
often first noticed in consequence of the child's complaints
about the presence of the candle in the room.</p>

<p>I have purposely dwelt long on this preliminary stage because
it is only in it that treatment is likely to be of any service,
while the very indefiniteness of the symptoms constantly leads
to their being overlooked, or referred to teething, or thought at
any rate to be a mere temporary ailment for which it is not
worth while to call in the doctor.</p>

<p>After four or five days, however, the illness of the child
becomes too marked to escape notice. All cheerfulness has
fled, the eyes are closed to shut out the light, the child lies
apparently dozing, but answers questions rationally, in a short
quick manner in as few words as possible, and from time to
time complains of its head, or utters a short, sharp lamentable
cry. The night brings with it no other change than an increase
of restlessness, attended sometimes with noisy cries, or with
the wandering talk of delirium. Sickness often diminishes,
but the bowels continue constipated, and it is to be noted that
whereas in fevers the bowels are distended with wind, here all
wind has disappeared and the belly is sunken to a striking
degree.</p>

<p>Next comes the last stage. Each stage is distinguished by
peculiarities of the pulse which tell the expert what is passing;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>quick and regular in the first stage; irregular and slower in the
second; quick, variable, irregular from time to time in the
third; growing more rapid and more feeble as the end arrives.
Squinting, stupor, dilated pupil, difficulty of swallowing,
tremulous limbs, convulsions, profound insensibility, such are
the series of occurrences which bring on death usually within
a fortnight, always within three weeks from the appearance of
the first decided symptoms.</p>

<p>What are you to do in these cases? Above all save yourselves
the heartbreak of feeling that you have overlooked the
premonitory symptoms of the disease. Guard with special care
the health of any child in whose family a disposition to consumptive
disease has ever shown itself, and keep it at any cost
from the risk of catching the hooping cough or measles. Since,
too, it is not in early infancy, but after the age of one year, and
in the majority of instances between the ages of three and six
years that this disease occurs, that is to say, at the time when
the brain begins to be most actively exercised, when the new
world on which the child is just entering brings with it new
wonders every day; be very careful not to over-stimulate its
intelligence, over-excite its imagination, or over-strain its mental
powers. After the age of ten the great danger is over; up to
that time it is the health of the body which requires care; not
fuss, not rearing like a hothouse plant, but the healthy training
that may fortify the system.</p>

<p>When any signs such as I have described indicate the
threatening of disease, do not look on them as within the scope
of domestic management, but place the child at once under
the watchful care of a skilful doctor. I have seen but one
recovery in all my life, after the disease had fully set in, and that
was a recovery almost worse than death.</p>

<p><b>Earache.</b>&mdash;There is another form of inflammation of the
brain which is likewise oftenest met with in children who are of
weakly constitution, or of scrofulous habit, or in whom scarlet
fever has left behind that very troublesome ailment, discharge
from the ear. This is so tedious, so difficult to cure, so apt to
return under the influence of very slight causes, that people are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>too ready to put up with it as an inconvenience which it is useless
to try to remedy.</p>

<p>In addition, however, to the risk of the child's hearing
being impaired by the extension of the mischief to the internal
ear, there is another still greater danger, namely, that of the
<i>disease passing from the ear to the brain</i>, and producing inflammation
of its membranes, or even abscess of its substance.</p>

<p>It is therefore of the greatest moment that every case of
chronic discharge from the ear should be looked on as important,
and that no pains be spared to bring about its cure; and
further, that during its continuance the slightest sign of disturbance
of the brain&mdash;headache, sickness, feverishness, and dulness&mdash;should
at once be noticed, and the advice of a competent
doctor be immediately sought for.</p>

<p>These dangers, however, follow almost entirely on long-continued
discharges from the ear, but do not attend that
acute inflammation of the passage to the ear which is often
met with in childhood, and the symptoms of which sometimes
cause needless fear, from being taken for those of inflammation
of the brain. Attacks of <i>earache</i> are most frequent before the
first set of teeth have been cut, and are by no means rare in
young children, who are perfectly unable to point out the seat
of their sufferings. The attack sometimes comes on quite
suddenly, but usually the child is languid and fretful for a
period varying from a few hours to one or two days before
acute pain is experienced. In this premonitory stage, however,
it will often cry if tossed or moved briskly; noise seems
unpleasant to it, and it does not care to be played with; while
children who are still at the breast show a disinclination to
suck, though they will take food from a spoon. The infant
seeks to rest its head on its mother's shoulder, or, if lying in
its cot, moves its head uneasily from side to side, and then
buries its face in the pillow. If you watch closely, you will see
that it is always the same side of the head which it seeks to
bury in the pillow, or to rest on its nurse's arm, and that no
other position seems to give any ease, except this one, which,
after much restlessness, the child will take up, and to which, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>disturbed, it will always return. The gentle support to the ear
seems to soothe the little patient: it cries itself to sleep, but
after a short doze, some fresh twinge of pain arouses it, or
some accidental movement disturbs it, and it awakes crying
aloud, and refusing to be pacified, and may continue so for
hours together. Sometimes the ear is red, and the hand is
often put to the affected side of the head, but neither of these
symptoms is constant. The intensity of the pain seldom lasts
for more than a few hours, when, in many instances a copious
discharge of matter takes place from the ear, and the child is
well. In some instances, indeed, the subsidence of the disease
on one side is followed by a similar attack on the opposite
side, and the same acute suffering is once more gone through,
and terminates in the same manner. Sometimes, too, this
complete cure does not take place, but the earache abates, or
altogether ceases, for a day or two, and then returns; no
discharge, or but a very scanty discharge, taking place, while,
for weeks together, the child has but few intervals of perfect
ease. In infants, earache seldom follows this chronic course,
but it does sometimes in older children, and is then of the
more importance, since it shows that the disease is no longer
confined to the external passage, but has extended to the
internal ear.</p>

<p>In children who are too young to express their sufferings
by words, the violence of their cries, coupled with the absence
of any sign of disease in the chest or the bowels, naturally leads
to the suspicion of something being wrong in the head. There
are several facts, however, which may satisfy you that the case
is not one of water on the brain&mdash;the child does not vomit, its
bowels are not constipated, there is but little fever, the cries
are loud and passionate, and are attended with shedding tears.
If you watch closely, you will notice the dread of movement
and the evident relief afforded by resting one side of the head,
and always the same side, while often the movement of the
hand to the head, and the redness of the ear, with the swelling
at its entrance, will all serve to point to that organ as the source
of the trouble. Sometimes, when in doubt, you will be able
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>to satisfy yourselves that the cause of the suffering is in the ear
by pressing the gristle of the organ slightly inwards, which will
produce very evident pain on the affected side, while on the
other side it will not occasion any suffering.</p>

<p>The treatment of this painful affection is very simple. In
many instances the suffering is greatly relieved by warm fomentations,
or by applying to the ear a poultice of hot bran or
camomile flowers, while at the same time a little warm oil and
laudanum are dropped into the ear. When these means do
not bring relief, a leech applied on the bone directly behind
the ear seldom fails to give ease; while the disposition to the
frequent return of the attack is often controlled by a series of
small blisters, not larger than a sixpence, behind the ear. As
soon as the tendency has sufficiently abated to admit of it, the
ear should be syringed out twice a day with warm water, or
with equal parts of warm water and Goulard lotion; but if
pain or discharge still continues, medical advice must in all
cases be sought for.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Water on the Brain.</b>&mdash;There is still another
form of inflammation of the brain, concerning which a few words
will suffice. It constitutes what is termed <i>chronic water on the
brain</i>, and in this instance the term is a correct one, for the
disease usually depends on a slow form of inflammation of the
lining membrane of the cavities of the brain, often beginning before,
still oftener very soon after, birth, which ends in the pouring
out of a quantity of fluid into them sufficient to enlarge
the head to three or four times its natural dimensions.</p>

<p>Such cases are very sad and very hopeless, and the great
resource, which is sometimes adopted by medical men, of
puncturing the head and letting out the fluid, is very seldom
successful.</p>

<p>But there are more hopeful cases sometimes met with, those
namely of children in whom, either from simple weakness, or
from that constitutional disorder called rickets, bone formation
has been backward, and the head has consequently long remained
unclosed. If such children, either from the irritation
of teething, or from the straining during paroxysms of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>hooping cough, suffer from congestion of the brain, fluid may
be poured out, which, not being compressed by the too yielding
skull, may in consequence enlarge it. These cases, however,
may be distinguished from the other more serious ones by the
date of their commencement, which is always much later than
that of the other form, by the symptoms which attend them
being less severe, and by the enlargement of the skull being
far slighter.</p>

<p>Still they require watching, for while with improved health
the enlargement ceases, the fluid is in a measure absorbed, and
the head diminishes in size, though always remaining larger
than the average; brain mischief is yet more readily set up in
children with such antecedents than in others.</p>

<p>The anxiety of parents about the size or shape of their
child's head after infancy has passed, is perfectly needless.
When the head has once closed it always remains so. An odd
shape, with an unusual protuberance of the forehead and the
hind head, sometimes remain as the evidence of that condition
in infancy to which I have just referred. It is, however, an
evidence of mischief passed, not of mischief going on. In
children too who have suffered from rickets, an affection rarely
met with except among the poor in crowded cities, distortion
of the limbs is often associated with a peculiar form of the
skull, but in this too there is nothing to call for anxiety, still
less to excite alarm. It is only a preternaturally small head
and shelving forehead, which are found associated with mental
deficiency; otherwise the greatest varieties of size and shape,
of symmetry, or of want of it, may be associated with an equal
variety of intellectual endowment, which is just as likely to be
above as below the average.</p>

<p><b>Brain Disorder from Exhaustion.</b>&mdash;It may at first
sight appear strange that before leaving the subject of congestion
and inflammation of the brain, I should find it necessary to give
a caution against being misled by symptoms which though in
some respects similar to those of congestion or inflammation,
are in reality due to an exactly opposite condition.</p>

<p>This mistake, however, is very possible; doctors themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>sometimes fall into it,
and some distinguished physicians have
thought it worth their while to lay down very minute rules for
distinguishing between the two opposite states. Headache we
all know attends an overfull condition of the vessels of the
brain, and grown persons usually suffer from it severely before
an attack of apoplexy; but we also know that bad headache
accompanies states of great weakness, and that it is one of the
most distressing consequences from which a woman suffers who
has lost much blood in her confinement. In just the same
way, the infant who has been exhausted by diarrh&oelig;a or by some
trying illness, or who after weaning has been kept on a diet not
sufficiently nutritious, may show symptoms of disorder of the
brain.</p>

<p>It may become irritable, restless, very startlish, with occasional
flushings of the face, moaning in its sleep, and sleeping
with half-closed eyes. But the head is not hotter than the rest
of the body; if the head is not closed, the open part or
fontanelle is not tense and pulsating, but flat or even depressed,
the hands and feet are cool, and very readily become cold;
there may be occasional vomiting, but nothing like the constant
sickness of real brain-disease, the bowels are not shrunken but
distended, constipation is not present, but on the contrary there
is a disposition to diarrh&oelig;a. If the symptoms are misinterpreted
and wrongly treated, unmistakable signs of exhaustion
at last come on, and the child may die from its not being borne
in mind that results at first sight much the same may flow
from causes diametrically opposite.</p>

<p>The moral of this is too obvious for me to need insist
upon it. Cold to the head, low diet, aperients, possibly
leeches, are needed in the one case; increased nourishment,
perhaps stimulants, in the other. In every instance where
symptoms of brain disorder occur in the child, remember the
grievous consequences of a mistake as to their nature, and seek
for further help and guidance to preserve you from the possibility
of error.</p>

<p><b>Spasmodic Croup.</b>&mdash;I have already tried to explain how,
in early life, the brain is often unequal to control the sensitiveness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>of the nervous system to various sources of irritation from
without, and how, in consequence this irritation manifests itself
by those involuntary movements which we call convulsions.
But in addition to, or in the place of those violent contortions
or convulsions, the same condition shows itself sometimes in
disordered action of the muscles which subserve parts not
directly subject to the will, as those for instance which open and
close the entrance to the windpipe, or glottis as it is called in
medical phraseology.</p>

<p>Cases in which this occurs are known in popular language
as child-crowing, or <i>spasmodic croup</i>, from the peculiar catch or
crow which accompanies the entrance of air through the spasmodically
contracted opening of the windpipe; a spasm which
if severe and sufficiently continued closes the opening altogether,
so that after fruitless efforts to get its breath the child
dies suffocated. This affection occurs chiefly during teething,
just as the fits of a hysterical girl oftenest occur during the
transition from girlhood to womanhood; but many other causes
besides the local irritation of the teeth may produce it, such as
constipation, indigestible food, or disorder of the bowels.</p>

<p>It does not often occur in perfectly healthy children; but
an infant who is attacked by it is usually observed to have been
drooping for some time previously, to have lost its appetite,
to have become fretful by day and restless at night, and to
present many of those ill-defined ailments which are popularly
ascribed to teething. At length, after these symptoms have
lasted for a few days or weeks, a slight crowing sound is occasionally
heard with the child's respiration, shorter, more high-pitched,
but less loud than the hoop of hooping cough.
Usually it is first noticed on the child awaking out of sleep,
but sometimes it is perceived during a fit of crying, or comes
on while the infant is sucking. The spasm may have been
excited by some temporary cause, and the sound which is its
token may not be heard again; but generally it returns after
the lapse of a few hours, or of a day or two, and its loudness
usually increases in proportion as its return becomes more
frequent. It will soon be found that certain conditions favour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>its occurrence; that the child wakes suddenly with an attack of
it, that excitement induces it, or the act of swallowing, or the
effort at sucking, so that the child will drop the nipple, make a
peculiar croupy sound with its breathing, and then return to
the breast again. Throughout the whole course of the affection,
its attacks will be found to be more frequent by night than by
day; and to occur mostly soon after the child has lain down to
sleep, or towards midnight, when the first sound sleep is drawing
to a close.</p>

<p>At first, the child seems, during the intervals of the attack,
much as before; except, perhaps, that it is rather more pettish
and wilful; but it is not long before graver symptoms than the
occasional occurrence of an unusual sound when the child
draws a deep breath excite attention, and give rise to alarm.
Fits of difficult breathing occasionally come on, in which the
child throws its head back, while its face and lips become livid,
or an ashy paleness surrounds the mouth, slight convulsive
movements pass over the muscles of the face; the chest is
motionless, and suffocation seems impending. But in a few
seconds the spasm yields, expiration is effected, and a long
loud crowing inspiration succeeds, or the child begins to cry.
Breathing now goes on naturally: the crowing is not repeated,
or the crying ceases; a look of apprehension dwells for a
moment on the infant's features, but then passes away; it turns
once more to its playthings, or begins sucking again as if
nothing were the matter. A few hours, or even a few days,
may pass before this alarming occurrence is again observed, but
it does recur, and another symptom of the disturbance of the
nervous system is soon superadded, if it has not, as is often
the case, existed from the very beginning. This consists in a
peculiar contraction of the hands and feet; a state which may
likewise not infrequently be noticed during infancy, unattended
by any peculiarity in breathing. It differs much in degree;
sometimes the thumb is simply drawn into the palm while the
fingers are unaffected; at other times the fingers are closed
more or less firmly, and the thumb is shut into the palm; or,
coupled with this, the hand itself is forcibly flexed on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>wrist. In the slightest degree of affection of the foot, the
great toe is drawn a little away from the other toes; in severer
degrees the toe is drawn away still further, and the whole foot
is forcibly bent upon the ankle, and its sole directed a little
inwards. Affection of the hands generally precedes the affection
of the feet, and may even exist without it, but the spasmodic
contraction of the feet never exists without the hands being
involved likewise. At first this state is temporary, but it does
not come on and cease simultaneously with the attacks of crowing
breathing, though generally much aggravated during its
paroxysms. Sometimes a child in whom the crowing breathing
has been heard, will awake in the morning with the hands and
feet firmly bent, though he may not have had any attack of
difficult breathing during the night. When the contraction is
but slight, children still use their hands; but when considerable
they cannot employ them, and they sometimes cry, as if
the contraction of the muscles were attended with pain.
Sometimes, too, there is a degree of puffiness both of hands
and feet, a sort of dropsical condition, which, whenever it is
present, adds much to the anxiety with reference to the child.</p>

<p>As the condition becomes more serious, a slight crowing
sound is heard each time the child draws its breath, the fits of
difficult breathing are much more severe; they last longer, and
sometimes end in general convulsions. The breathing now
does not return at once to its natural frequency, but continues
hurried for a few minutes after the occurrence of each fit of
difficult breathing, and is sometimes attended with a little
wheezing. The slightest cause is now sufficient to bring on an
attack; it may be produced by a current of air, by a sudden
change of temperature, by slight pressure on the windpipe, by
the act of swallowing, or by momentary excitement. The state
of sleep seems particularly favourable to its occurrence, and
the short fitful dozes are interrupted by the return of impending
suffocation, in one paroxysm of which longer and severer
than the others the infant may fall back dead.</p>

<p>It scarcely need be said that the great majority of cases
have no such sad ending as I have described, but still, whenever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>this spasm exists, even in a slight degree, there is always
the possibility, never to be forgotten, of a sudden catastrophe.
Usually, after some tooth has been cut which caused special
irritation, or as disorder of the bowels has been set right, the
symptoms abate by degrees, and then cease altogether, though
liable to be reproduced by the same causes as those to which
they were originally due.</p>

<p>The seeking out and removing the exciting causes must
be the care of the medical man, but there are some special
precautions which come within the mother's own province to
observe.</p>

<p>First of all, as sudden excitement, and especially a fit of
crying, are likely to bring on the attack, and since there is a
possibility that any attack may prove fatal, the greatest care
must be taken in the management of the child to avoid all unnecessary
occasion of annoyance or of distress.</p>

<p>Although the benefit that accrues from fresh air, or from a
change of air, is often very great, yet it is very important that
the child should not be exposed to the cold or wind, for I have
seen such exposure followed by a severe attack of difficult breathing,
or by the occurrence of general convulsions. Another reason
for caution in this respect is that the occurrence of catarrh is
almost sure to be followed by an aggravation of the spasmodic
affection, which, though previously slight, may thereby be rendered
serious or even dangerous.</p>

<p>I have nothing to add to what I have already said with
reference to the treatment of the attack, when actual convulsions
come on. Since, however, in this affection convulsions
may occur quite unexpectedly at any moment, it is well always
to have a basin of cold water and a bunch of feathers handy,
in order to be able at once to dash the water on the child's
face, and induce that deep inspiration which saves it from
the threatening danger. If this should not suffice, the finger
must be put into the mouth, and run over the back of the
tongue in the way that I have already explained when speaking
of convulsions. Now and then it happens, though but very
rarely, that violent <i>general convulsions</i> come on in infancy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>quite independent of spasmodic croup, not preceded nor
attended by any sign of disease of the brain, and which end in
the course of some hours or of a few days in death, the child
being partly worn out by the violence of the muscular movements,
partly by the disturbance of breathing which each fit
occasions. Happily, however, in most of these instances the
convulsions by degrees lessen both in violence and frequency,
and the child recovers.</p>

<p><b>Epilepsy.</b>&mdash;There is one other point of view from which
convulsions in infancy and early childhood must be looked
on with apprehension, and that is from their being frequently
followed in after years by <i>epilepsy</i>. In nearly a fifth of all
cases of epilepsy in childhood that have come under my notice
the first occurrence of fits dated back to early infancy, and
this, even though an interval of years had passed between the
last fit in infancy and the first in childhood. It seems, indeed,
as though there were in these cases a peculiar abiding sensitiveness
of the nervous system, which, dating back from very
early life, dependent often on hereditary predisposition, was
kindled into activity by any special cause, such as the cutting
of the second set of teeth, or the transition from boyhood or
girlhood to manhood or womanhood.</p>

<p>In the child, just as in the grown person, epilepsy manifests
itself in two different ways; either by momentary unconsciousness,
or by violent convulsions, in which latter there is little
distinction from the occasional fit which may be observed at
any period of infancy.</p>

<p>The attacks of momentary unconsciousness often pass long
unnoticed. They occur, perhaps, when the child is at play or at
meals; it stops as if dazed, its eye fixed on vacancy; if standing,
it does not fall, nor does it drop the toy or the spoon which it
was holding from its hand. If speaking, it just breaks off in
the midst of the half-uttered sentence. Then, in less time than
it takes to tell, it suddenly looks up again, finishes what it was
saying, or goes on with its play, or with its meal as though
nothing had happened; or it suffices to call the child and the
cloud passes from its face, and it is itself again; and the nurse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>or perhaps even the mother, thinks that it is some odd trick
which the child has got. By degrees the attacks become more
frequent, and may continue to recur several times a day without
any obvious cause, even for months; and this without any
change in their character. By degrees, however, under their
influence, an alteration takes place slowly in the child's disposition.
It loses its cheerfulness and brightness, its face
assumes a heavy look, it becomes fretful, and its intelligence
grows duller.</p>

<p>Almost invariably after the attacks of this, which has been
called the <i>petit mal</i>, have continued for some months, a change
begins to take place, which does not fail to excite attention and
to cause alarm. If seated, the child's head drops forward for
a moment, and strikes against the table; if standing, it becomes
for an instant dizzy, and staggers, or even falls, and then there
is twitching of one limb, or of the muscles of the face, and then
the complete fit of epilepsy, ushered in sometimes, but not always,
by a momentary cry, and then the convulsive twitching of one
limb, followed in a minute or in less time by convulsions of the
whole body as well as of the limbs. The upturned eyes, which
do not see, are horribly distorted, the child foams at the mouth,
it is insensible, and the insensibility deepens into stupor, or is
followed by heavy sleep, for a quarter of an hour, or an hour or
more, from which the patient arouses feeling tired and bruised,
and often with an aching head, but with no remembrance of
what has passed during the seizure so distressing to bystanders.</p>

<p>It has throughout been my endeavour not to lose sight of
those for whom this little book has been written, and with reference
to epilepsy, as with reference to many other things, I pass
over much that would be important to the practitioner of medicine,
to dwell on those points which mainly interest the parents,
and which they are perfectly able to appreciate.</p>

<p>The question is often put as to the probability of fits terminating
in epilepsy; or, on the other hand, as to the ground for
hope in any case that epileptic attacks, which have already often
recurred, will eventually cease. In the first place, no conclusion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>can safely be drawn from the severity of a convulsion, nor from
its general character, as to the probability of its frequent recurrence,
or of its passing into permanent epilepsy. The severity
of a fit certainly affords no reason for this apprehension, nor
does its recurrence, so long as a distinct exciting cause can be
discovered for each return. The fits, which cease in the teething
child when the gum is lanced, and which, on each succeeding
return are equally relieved by the same proceeding, do not
imply that there is any great tendency on their part to become
habitual. In the same way, the attacks which follow on constipation,
or on indigestion, or on some other definite exciting
cause, may probably with care be guarded against, and their
return prevented. It is not the violence of a single fit, nor even
the frequent return of fits for a limited time, which warrants the
gravest apprehension; but it is their recurrence when all observable
causes of irritation have passed away; it is their return
when the child is otherwise apparently in perfect health.</p>

<p>If, on the one hand, the violence of a convulsion does not
by any means imply the greater proportionate risk of its recurrence,
so neither can any hopeful conclusion be drawn from the
slightness of an attack, or from its momentary duration. In
childhood, such attacks are at least as common preludes to confirmed
epilepsy as in the adult, and are the more deserving of
attention from their very liability to be overlooked. I believe,
too, that an imperfect suspension of consciousness, the child
knowing what passes, though unable to speak, is not very uncommon,
and further, that it is far from unusual to have the
early stage of epilepsy in childhood announced by sudden incoherent
talking for a few seconds, or by a wild look; a cry of
surprise, or a short fit of sobbing, announcing as in a hysterical
girl, the close of the paroxysm. The early symptoms of
epilepsy in childhood are also the more likely to be misinterpreted
from the circumstance that they are frequently accompanied
by a moral perversion much more striking than any loss
of mental power. It is true that in early life there are alternations
of intellectual activity and mental indolence, of quickness
and comparative dulness, which all who have had much to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>with education are well aware of, and which are perfectly compatible
with health of body and health of mind. But changes
in the moral character of a child who is still under the same
influences, have a far deeper meaning than is often attached
to them; a child does not suddenly become wayward, fretful,
passionate, or mischievous, except under the pressure of some
grave cause.</p>

<p>One other point there is also to be borne in mind; namely,
that the child is compelled by the vague sensation of hitherto
unknown dread, not to conceal the early symptoms of epilepsy
as the grown person would do; longing as the child does for
love and sympathy, and weakened in its moral force, it craves
for more love, more sympathy, it exaggerates its symptoms, it
assumes some which do not exist at all. The conclusion is a
natural one, but none the less mistaken, that the child who is
discovered to be shamming has nothing the matter with it&mdash;is
simply a naughty child. This is a fact of much importance, on
which I shall have occasion to insist further on.</p>

<p>In the child, as in the adult, epilepsy blunts the intellect as
well as weakens the moral powers; and does both more speedily
and more effectually in proportion as the child is younger, and
its mind and will are less developed. And yet this has its
compensation; for as the powers fade quickly, so, if the attacks
cease, they recover with surprising rapidity, and as the moral
powers are the first to suffer, so they are the first to regain&mdash;I
will not say full vigour, but at least a degree which raises the
children to be objects of specially tender affection, rather than
of pity and compassion.</p>

<p>The conditions which justify the most hopeful view of any
case of epilepsy are then, first, the absence of any history of
frequently recurring convulsions in early infancy; secondly, the
existence of a distinct exciting cause for the attacks; thirdly,
the rarity of their return far more than their slight severity; and
lastly, the more the attacks approach in character to what one
knows as hysteria, the less profound the insensibility in the fit,
the shorter its duration afterwards, the greater are the grounds
for hope that the seizures will eventually cease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>Cases of this last class are to some degree, at any rate,
under the child's control. I have several times seen a fit
warded off by the threat of the shower bath, or even by calling
to the child, and sending it to fetch something in another
room. Such cases may indeed pass into ordinary epilepsy, but
often, under judicious management, moral rather than medical,
they cease, so that one can venture on taking a more hopeful
view of them than of others.</p>

<p>And this brings me to the question of what can be done,
or rather what can parents do to promote recovery from epilepsy.
First of all, do not listen to what you may hear about this medicine
or the other being a specific for it. There is no specific whatever
for epilepsy, but there are certain remedies which in skilful
hands do have a real though limited power to control the
frequency and lessen the severity of the attacks. Next, there
are cases in which the attacks depend on some definite cause;
it may be indigestion, or constipation, or the cutting of the
second set of teeth, and on the irritation produced by those
teeth being too crowded. Thus, I remember a boy twelve
years old, in whom two severe epileptic fits occurred apparently
without cause. He was cutting his back grinding teeth, and
in the lower jaw the teeth seemed overcrowded. I had a
tooth extracted on either side, the fits ceased, and when I last
heard of him many years afterwards they had not returned.</p>

<p>Epilepsy often lasts for many years, and no one's memory
is retentive enough to be trusted with all the details between
the different attacks, the causes which seemed to produce
them, the measures which appeared at different times to be of
service. I am therefore accustomed to advise people, any of
whose children have the misfortune to be epileptic, to write as
brief an account as possible of the child's previous history, and
to supplement it by a daily record kept in parallel columns of
date, food, state of bowels, sleep, medicine, attacks, specifying
their character and duration; and general remarks, which
would bear on the child's temper and general condition, and
in which column any probable exciting cause of an attack
would be recorded. It is surprising how much important information
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>is gathered in a few months from such a record kept
faithfully.</p>

<p>The diet should be mild, nutritious, but as a general rule
unstimulating; and should include meat comparatively seldom,
and in small quantities. Some fifty years ago, a very distinguished
American physician, Dr. Jackson of Boston, in the
United States, insisted very strongly on the importance of a
diet exclusively of milk and vegetables in greatly lessening the
frequency and severity of epileptic attacks. I believe in the
great majority of cases of epilepsy in childhood Dr. Jackson's
advice is worth following. And I may add that, while I have
little faith in the influence of mere drugs, I have a yearly increasing
confidence in that of judicious management, mental
and moral, as well as physical.</p>

<p>The first requisite in all cases is a firm and gentle rule of
love on the part of those who have charge of the child. As
violent and sudden excitement of any kind will often bring on
an epileptic seizure, so the influence of the opposite condition
in warding off its attacks is very remarkable; and on several
occasions I have received patients into the Children's Hospital
who were reported to have epileptic seizures several times in a
day, and who nevertheless remained a fortnight or more in the
institution without any attack coming on. The disorder, however,
was not cured, but only kept in check by the gentle rule
to which the little ones were subjected. The order goes for
much in these cases; the novelty goes for something too, for
almost invariably I have found that after a time the apparent
improvement becomes less marked, and though they continued
better than when they first came to the hospital, the children
were still epileptic; the advance of the disease had been retarded,
but its progress had not been arrested. The quiet
then which suits the epileptic, is not the quiet of listless,
apathetic idleness, but the judicious alternation of tranquil
occupation and amusement. The mind must not be left to
slumber from the apprehension of work bringing on a fit, but
the work must, as far as possible, be such as to interest the
child. In the occupations of epileptics therefore, pursuits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>which not merely employ the mental faculties, but also give work
to the hands, such as gardening, carpentering, or the tending
of animals, are specially to be recommended; and if by these
the mind can be kept awake, the grand object of teaching is
answered, and backwardness in reading, writing, or those kinds
of knowledge which other children at the same age have
acquired, is of very little moment. Many epileptics have an
indistinct articulation, and almost all have a slouching gait, and
an awkward manner. The former can often be corrected to a
considerable degree by teaching the child simple chants, which
are almost always easily acquired, and practised with pleasure.
The latter may be rectified by drilling, not carried out into
tedious minuti&aelig;, but limited to simple movements; and the
irksomeness of drill is almost completely done away with by
music, while I believe that the accustoming a child to the
strict control and regulation of all its voluntary movements is
of very great importance indeed as a curative agent.</p>

<p>It is difficult to carry out these minute precautions on
which so much depends in the home with other children of the
same family. It is therefore, I believe, better for the child,
painful though it is to the parents, that he should be placed
under the care of some competent person who will devote the
whole of his time to the care of the patient.</p>

<p><b>St. Vitus's Dance.</b>&mdash;A state of unconsciousness, accompanied
with more or less violent involuntary movements, is
characteristic of epilepsy. Involuntary movements without
loss of consciousness constitute the disorder commonly known
as <i>St. Vitus's Dance</i>. It is rare in early childhood, becomes
more common after the age of five, and attains its greatest frequency
between the ages of ten and fifteen, girls, owing to
their more impressionable nervous system, being affected by it
more than twice as often as boys.</p>

<p>It seldom comes on in a child previously in perfect
health, and strangely enough it occurs with special frequency
in children who have before suffered from rheumatism. Sudden
shock or fright is often said to have been its exciting cause;
but even then the symptoms seldom come at once, but are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>gradually developed in the course of two or three days. At
first, it is noticed that the child has certain odd fidgety movements,
usually of one arm, next of the leg of the same side, so
that it stumbles in walking, and then the muscles of the face
become affected, the child grimacing strangely, and next the
limbs of the opposite side become involved, and as things go on
from bad to worse, the child becomes unable to hold anything
in its hand, to walk, or even to stand, and even if on the ground
still writhes about with the strangest contortions of its body.
If matters grow still worse, the child becomes unable to put
out its tongue, it swallows with difficulty, it loses not only the
power of distinct articulation but even the faculty of speech,
while the mind itself becomes weakened, the child seems half
idiotic, and even though the movements lessen in violence,
power over the limbs is lost for the time, and they seem almost
paralysed. Happily cases so severe are very rare, and it is
rarer still for them to have a fatal termination. Almost invariably
recovery takes place by degrees, the movements lessen,
swallowing is performed with less difficulty, the power of speech,
returns, and the intellect regains its brightness: but the child
is left with a special liability to return of the affection, though
the first attack is usually the most severe.</p>

<p>Even at the best, however, the disorder is always tedious,
as is shown by the fact that its average duration is seventy
days. It is very natural, therefore, that parents should be
anxious when they see that their child has some awkward or
ungainly habit, some odd trick or gesture never noticed before,
lest it should be the beginning of this tedious ailment. Now
it is well to remember that St. Vitus's dance does not begin
with twitching of the muscles of the face, but that its earliest
symptoms are involuntary movements of the arms and twitching
of the fingers, and that contortions of the face do not come on
till afterwards. Movements of this sort too, even when not
limited to the face, vary in the course of a few days in the
parts which they affect, and show themselves, now in winking
the eyes, then in grimacing, in twitching of the muscles of the
face or neck, or in some awkward gait or manner. These are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>all best left unnoticed, for they are almost invariably made
worse if the child's attention is called to them. They are, or
at least before the days of Board Schools they were, scarcely
ever met with among the children of the poor, for they almost
invariably depend on mental strain; not of necessity on undue
length of the hours of study, or on the difficulty of the tasks
imposed, but often on a child's anxiety to make progress and
to keep up with his schoolfellows. In corroboration of this
being their cause I may say that, contrary to the rule which
obtains with St. Vitus's dance, these movements are more
frequent in boys than in girls, for the over-mental strain of
boys comes earlier; that of girls seldom occurs before the time
of transition to womanhood, and its results are then different,
though much graver. In cases of this kind, lessening the
mental strain is almost always followed by a cessation of the
movements; change of air, country amusements, and a generally
tonic treatment perfect the cure, and dancing and gymnastics
overcome the remains of any awkward habit.</p>

<p>The movements in real St. Vitus's dance do not shift
about as these do from one part to another, but tend to involve
various parts in succession, without previously ceasing where
they had begun.</p>

<p>The relative share which the parents and the doctor take
in the treatment of these cases depends to a great extent on
their severity. While attention to the state of the bowels, and
a generally tonic treatment are almost always needed, gymnastics
and drill are often of very great service in the slighter cases;
and a very distinguished Paris physician was accustomed to
send children thus affected to march round the Place Vend&ocirc;me,
keeping step while the band was playing. The utility of gymnastics
turns very much on the degree in which the child is
able by attention to control his movements, and when either
as in young children fixed attention cannot be roused, or as in
severe cases the effort only adds to the child's nervousness,
and in consequence increases the movements, they must be
given up. All drill and gymnastics are best carried out in
class with other children, and regulated not simply by word of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>mouth, but by a tune or chant. When recovery is in progress
gymnastics will then in almost all instances find their place.</p>

<p>Even when drill and gymnastics cannot be practised, regulated
movements of the limbs carried out twice a day for ten
minutes at a time are of very real service. Another's will here
takes the place of that of the patient, and the limbs are thus
taught, though far more imperfectly, to act in concert.</p>

<p>Two or three more cautions may still be of service. Do
not keep a child out of bed, and force it to try to exert itself
when the movements are very severe; continued movement,
voluntary or involuntary, fatigues. Let the child lie in bed;
it rests there, and the movements, which always cease during
sleep, become at once greatly lessened. So important indeed
is it to avoid the exhaustion caused by incessant violent movement,
that in bad cases it is sometimes necessary to swathe
the limbs in flannel bandages, and so to confine them to splints
in order to restrain them. Next, do not become over-anxious
because the child grows stupid and ceases to talk; intelligence
and the power of speech will certainly come back again. And,
lastly, do not be impatient and think your medical adviser
incompetent because the disorder lasts so long. An average
duration of seventy days implies that while sometimes it ceases
sooner, in others it lasts much longer than the two weary months
of watching and waiting with which in any case you must lay
your account.</p>

<p><b>Paralysis, or Palsy.</b>&mdash;When speaking of St. Vitus's
dance I said that there was a partial loss of power in the
limbs as well as an inability to control their movements. After
a fit of convulsions, or an epileptic seizure, power over some
limb is often lost for a time which may vary from a few minutes
to some hours. In the course of some serious diseases of the
brain, one of the manifestations of the mischief is the impairment
or the loss of power over one arm or leg, rarely over
both; and lastly, that terrible disease diphtheria is often followed
by a paralysis so general that the patient is sometimes
for days unable to move even a finger, although the condition
may eventually pass away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>There is, however, a very <i>real paralysis</i> which occurs sometimes
in infants and young children. It comes on for the most
part quite suddenly, often unaccompanied by any sign of brain
disorder, but tending nevertheless to issue in great permanent
impairment of the power over the affected limb or limbs, and
eventually to interfere with their growth and thus to produce
serious deformity.</p>

<p>It is in general impossible to assign any distinct exciting
cause for the affection, though the fact that in two-thirds of
the cases it occurs between the ages of six months and three
years, proves it to be in some way intimately associated with
teething. The oldest child in whom I have ever seen it was
aged between seven and eight years, and the youngest a little
under six months. It is of excessive rarity for the arm alone
to be affected, but it is by no means unusual for the legs alone
to be paralysed; though in the majority of instances power is
lost on one side only, the leg and arm being both involved.</p>

<p>A child goes to bed quite well, or at the worst having
seemed slightly ailing and feverish for a day or two, and on
waking in the morning it is suddenly discovered that power is
lost over one leg or both, or over both arm and leg of one
side. The loss of power is at first seldom complete, though
neither arm nor leg can be used to any good purpose, and
during the ensuing twenty-four hours the palsy often grows
worse, and sometimes affects one or both limbs of the opposite
side. After that time recovery in general begins. It is now and
then speedy, so that in three or four days all trace of the paralysis
may have disappeared. This, however, is a fortunate exception
to the general rule, which is that amendment is very tardy,
showing itself first in the arm, afterwards in the leg, and, if
both sides have been affected, more on one side than on the
other. Unless the improvement is very rapid, it is almost
always only partial, and the palsied limb, though it does not
lose sensation, regains but little power; it grows much more
slowly than the other, is always colder and wastes considerably,
while, some muscles still retaining more power than others,
it becomes twisted out of shape, and requires all the skill of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>the orthop&aelig;dic surgeon to remedy or at least to lessen the
consequent deformity.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained that this form of palsy depends on
a state of congestion, or overfilling of the minute blood-vessels
of the spinal marrow. When the child gets well the congestion
has passed away; but it does this speedily, and recovery is
then rapid as well as complete. If it does not soon pass away,
other changes take place in the spinal marrow, and recovery
is then slow, incomplete, or even does not take place at all.</p>

<p>Remedies are unfortunately of little avail here, but it is
evident that when the palsy is quite recent all movement of
the limb must be mischievous, and that the congestion of the
spinal marrow to which it is due will be most likely to abate
under the influence of perfect quiet, rest in bed, and soothing
or fever medicines, or of such as are calculated to overcome
constipation, or to correct any fault of digestion, while the
importance of teething, and the possible expediency of lancing
the gums must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Afterwards comes the time for exercise of the paralysed
limb, for friction, for shampooing, for galvanism; all continued
perhaps for months or years with unwearied patience, and I
must add with reasonable expectations as to the result. The
only additional remark which I have to make is this, that to
gain any real good from galvanism, a battery must be procured
under the direction of some medical man specially skilled in
the use of electricity, and the mode of employing it must be
learned thoroughly from him. It is merely idle to purchase a
toy machine, and, giving it to the nurse to turn the handle for
ten minutes twice a day, to fancy that you are making a serious
trial of the effects of galvanism. As a mere money question,
a costly machine, and several fees paid in order to be thoroughly
instructed in the way to use it, is much cheaper than a
cripple child.</p>

<p>A few words may not be out of place with reference to
cases in which paralysis is mistakenly supposed to exist. Much
anxiety is sometimes expressed by parents concerning children
who have long passed the usual age without making any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>attempt to walk; or who having once walked seem to have
lost that power. Now it often happens that after any weakening
illness a child ceases for some weeks to walk, just as it
ceases to talk. The power in both cases was newly acquired,
it called for effort which, when strength is regained, will be put
forth once more. The same applies to other instances in
which children are late in learning to walk; or who, having
once walked, leave off walking when a back tooth, or when
one of the eye teeth is coming near the surface of the gum,
and regaining the power lose it again, or lose at least the
desire to exert it more than once during the active progress of
teething. But, holding the child under its arms, you have but
to put its feet to the ground, and at once it will draw up its
legs though it will make no other movement; or take it on your
lap and tickle the soles of its feet, and laughing or crying, as
the mood takes it, it will move its legs about as freely as you
could wish and show that the power is still there, though for
the present the child will not take the trouble to exert it.</p>

<p>Gradual loss of power over one or other leg, especially if
attended with pain either in the back or in the knee or hip,
should always call for attention, and induce you to seek at
once for medical advice. Such cases generally occur later in
childhood than the conditions of which I spoke in the former
paragraph, and may depend on disease of the spine or of the
hip-joint, two serious conditions which it needs the medical
expert to discover and to treat.</p>

<p><b>Neuralgia and Headache.</b>&mdash;In the grown person neuralgia,
as many of us know to our cost, is by no means infrequent;
in the child it is very rare, and when a child
complains of severe pain in the head, or of severe pain to the
knee or hip apart from rheumatism, it is almost invariably the
sign of disease of the brain in the one case, of the hip-joint in
the other. To this rule there are indeed exceptions, but it will
always be well to leave it to the doctor to determine&mdash;no easy
matter by the bye&mdash;whether any given case is one of the rare
exceptions or not.</p>

<p>There is, however, one form of real <i>neuralgic headache</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>which is by no means rare in children after the commencement
of the second dentition, and which sometimes goes on into
early manhood or womanhood, when it becomes what is commonly
known as sick headache. It is essentially an ailment of
development, incidental to the time when the brain is first
called on for the performance of its higher functions.</p>

<p>It does not by any means always depend on over-study,
though I do not remember meeting with it in children who had
not yet gone into the school-room; and I have frequently
found it dependent on too continuous application, though the
number of hours devoted to study in the course of the day
may not have been by any means excessive.</p>

<p>The child's brain soon tires, and the arrangement, so convenient
to parents of morning lessons and afternoon play,
works far less well for it than if the time were more equally
divided between the two.</p>

<p>The attacks not infrequently come on on waking in the
morning, and rapidly become worse, the pain, which is almost
always referred to the forehead, being attended with much
intolerance of light and sound, with nausea, and often with
actual vomiting. Like the vomiting of sea-sickness, however,
previous stomach disorder has no necessary share in its production,
and I may add, indeed, that it is often difficult to
assign any special exciting cause for the attack. The suffering
is more often relieved by warm or tepid than by cold applications,
and not infrequently pressure or a tight bandage greatly
mitigates it. In no case does the attack last more than twelve
hours&mdash;usually not more than half that time; it passes off with
sleep, and leaves the patient weak and with a degree of tenderness
of the head to the touch.</p>

<p>Such attacks may occur every fortnight, ten days, or even
oftener, but their very frequent return, instead of increasing
apprehension, should diminish anxiety. A first attack, indeed,
may seem as though it threatened mischief, till it is seen how
speedily and completely it passes off, and when afterwards a
second or a third attack comes on with the same severity of
onset, the same rapid worsening, and the same quick passing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>away, you will feel convinced that the symptoms have no grave
meaning.</p>

<p>There is a headache of quite a different kind to which
I must for a moment refer, that, namely, which depends entirely
on imperfect vision, and for which spectacles are the remedy,
not physic. The infirmity is not noticed during the first few
years of life, but in later childhood, when a tolerably close attention
to study has become necessary. Some of the minor degrees
of short-sightedness, and want of power of adaptation of the
eyes, such as exists in the aged, soon begin to interfere sensibly
with the child's comfort, and the strain to which the eyes are
subject produces a constant pain over the brow, the cause of
which is often unsuspected.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In all cases, therefore, in which a child complains of constant
pain over the brow for which there is no obvious cause, it
is well to take the opinion of an oculist, who can best ascertain
the power of <i>reading at different distances</i> and with each eye
separately, and the real cause of symptoms which had occasioned
much anxiety is thus often brought to light.</p>

<p><b>Night Terrors.</b>&mdash;Before taking leave of the disorders of
the nervous system, I must briefly mention the Nightmare, or
Night Terrors of children, which often cause a degree of alarm
quite out of proportion to their real importance.</p>

<p>It happens sometimes that a child who has gone to bed
apparently well, and who has slept soundly for a short time,
awakes suddenly with a sharp and piercing cry. The child
will be found sitting up in bed, crying out as if in an agony
of fear, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! take it away! father! mother!'
while terror is depicted on its countenance, and it does not
recognise its parents, who, alarmed by the shrieks, have come
into its room, but seems wholly occupied by the fearful impression
that has roused it from sleep. By degrees consciousness
returns; the child now clings to its mother or its nurse,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>sometimes wants to be taken up and carried about the room,
and by degrees, sometimes in ten minutes, sometimes in half-an-hour,
it grows quiet and falls asleep; and then usually the
rest of the night is passed undisturbed, though sometimes a
second or even a third attack may occur before daybreak.</p>

<p>Seizures of this kind may come on in a great variety of
circumstances, and may either happen only two or three
times, or may continue to recur at intervals for several weeks.
The great point, however, to bear in mind is that they depend
invariably on some disorder of the stomach or bowels, and are
never an evidence of the commencement of real disease of the
brain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE DISORDERS AND DISEASES OF THE CHEST.</h3>


<p>In speaking of the ailments which occur during the first month
after birth, I have already noticed the peculiarities of breathing
in early infancy, and the difficulties that sometimes attend the
complete filling of the air-cells of the lungs, and the readiness
with which when once filled they become emptied of air and
collapse.</p>

<p>On this ground it is therefore needless for me again to
enter, and I may pass at once to consider those ailments which
rise in increasing importance from a simple cold or catarrh to
inflammation of the air-tubes or bronchitis, inflammation of the
lung substance, as pneumonia, and inflammation of the membrane
which lines the chest and covers the lungs, or pleurisy.</p>

<p><b>Catarrh.</b>&mdash;A common cold or <i>catarrh</i> is not one of the
ailments of very early infancy. The watery eyes, the sneezing,
the cough, the slight feverishness and the heavy head are
scarcely met with until after the age of three months; nor,
indeed, are they often seen till the child is old enough to run
about, to go out for a walk, and to encounter in consequence
all the variations of temperature and of damp or dryness inseparable
from the English climate.</p>

<p>This, however, is not entirely due to the greater exposure
of the child to these influences as it grows older, but in part
also to the fact that the lining of the air-tubes is less sensitive
in early infancy than it afterwards becomes. The young babe
if it catches cold gets <i>snuffles</i>, or stoppage of the nostrils, which
first become dry, and then pour out an abundant discharge,
which sometimes dries and forms crusts, and causes the child to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>suck with difficulty, and to breathe uncomfortably and with
open mouth. In a few days, however, at the worst this discomfort
passes away; and the only additional remark I have
to make is, that since obstinate snuffles are sometimes a
constitutional disease, the doctor's advice should always be sought
if they last longer than a week.</p>

<p>It is needless to describe a cold, but it is much more to
the purpose to say how its occurrence is to be prevented, and
nine times out of ten the observance of two simple rules will
suffice for this. First, take care that there is no great difference
between the temperature of the day and of the night
nursery. The one should never be above 60&deg;, nor the other
below 50&deg;, and the undressing and the bath should always take
place in the warmer room. Second, never let the child wear
the same shoes or boots in the house as it does out of doors.
The change should be as much a matter of routine as the
taking off its hat or its bonnet.</p>

<p>The domestic management of a cold is simple enough.
The usual error is the overdoing precautions, the keeping the
room too hot, or overloading the child with extra garments,
or its bed with extra covering, by which it is kept in a state of
feverishness, or of needlessly profuse perspiration.</p>

<p>If, for the first two days of a bad cold, the child is kept in
bed, the room being at a temperature of 60&deg;, with no extra
covering on the bed, but a flannel jacket for the child to wear
when it sits up in bed to play, a few drops of ipecacuanha wine
several times a day, a warm bath, a linseed poultice to the
chest, and a little paregoric at night, with a light diet of rice,
and arrowroot, and milk, and a roasted apple, and some orange
juice; nine times out of ten, or nineteen out of twenty, the
cold will pass away with small discomfort to the child and no
anxiety to the parents.</p>

<p>Often a child objects to stop all day in its little cot, but
move it to its mother's or nurse's big bed; and with a large
tray of toys before it, and a little of the tact which love
teaches, the day will pass in unclouded content and cheerfulness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>It must of course be borne in mind that measles set in with
all the symptoms of a bad cold, followed on the fourth day by
the appearance of the eruption; and, moreover, watchfulness
must always be alive to detect increase of fever, hurry of
breathing, hardness or extreme frequency of cough, the sign of
the irritation of the larger air-tubes having extended and
become more severe, the evidence that the case from simple
catarrh has become one of bronchitis.</p>

<p><b>Bronchitis and Pneumonia.</b>&mdash;It is impossible to enable
persons who have not received a medical education to distinguish
between a case of bronchitis and one of pneumonia.
Neither, indeed, is it of much importance that they should do
so, for in both the dangers are of a similar kind, and both call
equally for the advice of a skilful doctor.</p>

<p>In <i>bronchitis</i> inflammation affects the lining of the air-tubes,
travelling from the larger towards the smaller, and in
bad cases extending even to their termination in the minute
air-cells. The inflammation leads to the pouring out of a
secretion, which by degrees becomes thick like matter, or
even very tenacious, almost as tough as though it were a thin
layer of skin. If this is very extensive, and reaches to the
small air-cells, it is evident that air cannot enter, while that
elasticity of the lung which I have already spoken of tends to
drive out from the cells the small quantity of air they contained,
and the child dies suffocated, partly from the difficulty in the
entrance of air, partly from the collapse of air-cells from which
the air has been slowly expelled.</p>

<p>In <i>pneumonia</i> or inflammation of the lung-substance the
process is different. A portion of one or other lung, sometimes
of both, becomes overfilled with blood, or congested, and though
the air-tubes themselves are not the special seat of the congestion,
yet the air-cells are pressed on by the surrounding
swollen substance, and the entrance of air into them is impeded.
If the mischief goes further the substance becomes solid and
impervious to air, and lastly it becomes softened, its structure
destroyed, and infiltrated with matter; the affected part
becomes really an abscess, though not bounded by the distinct
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>limits which would shut in an abscess of the hand or the foot.
Inflammation, and the formation of an abscess anywhere is, as
we know, attended by fever and much general illness, and inflammation
of the lung is of course attended by fever and
general illness in proportion to the importance of the organ
affected. To these, too, must be added all the disturbance
inseparable from any ailment which gravely interferes with
breathing.</p>

<p>In the great majority of instances inflammation of the lung-substance
does not go on to the last stage, and recovery is not
only possible, but probable, from congestion and solidification of
the organ. Pneumonia, too, usually attacks only a portion of
one lung, while in bronchitis the air-tubes of both are always
involved. Hence of the two, serious bronchitis is more to be
dreaded than serious pneumonia.</p>

<p>Bronchitis is always developed out of previous catarrh,
though there is a wide difference between the duration of the
preliminary stage and the occurrence of serious symptoms in
different cases; while it may be laid down as a general rule
that the severity and danger of an attack are in proportion to
the rapidity of its onset. An attack of pneumonia, or inflammation
of the lung-substance sets in, as a rule, more suddenly,
with fever, a temperature of 103&deg; to 105&deg;, general distress, headache,
not unfrequently delirium; the urgency of which symptoms,
the hurried breathing and the short, dry, hacking cough, and
the tearless eyes are too often misinterpreted, and the state of
the chest not examined.</p>

<p>The doctor, of course, skilled in auscultation, will listen to
the chest and give to all these symptoms their true signification.
The lesson for the parent to bear in mind is never to
neglect in a child the symptoms of what may seem to be but a
common cold, but to seek for advice the moment the cough
shows any disposition to become hard, or the breathing hurried.
Next, when any sudden illness sets in with very high temperature
and much general ailing, not to let the disorder of the
head, or the delirium, make you shut your eyes to the import
of the short cough, the dry eyes, the hurried breathing; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>lastly, to remember that, grave though the symptoms may be,
the tendency in pneumonia is to eventual recovery, and that in
early life bronchitis is the graver of the two diseases.</p>

<p>A caution may not be out of place with reference to cases
which may occur during the epidemic prevalence of <i>influenza</i>.
A child is sometimes struck down by it, just as grown persons
are sometimes, with great depression, extreme rapidity of
breathing, and very high fever, which, passing off in a couple
of days, leave a state of great exhaustion behind. It is well to
bear in mind that such symptoms have no such grave meaning
when influenza is prevalent as they would have at another time;
and the knowledge of this fact may serve in some degree to
control your anxiety.</p>

<p><b>Pleurisy.</b>&mdash;It is not possible for anyone, without medical
experience, to discriminate between pneumonia, or inflammation
of the substance of the lung, and pleurisy, or inflammation
of its covering. Some degree of the latter, indeed, very often
accompanies the former, and this accounts for the pain which
interferes with every attempt of the child to draw a deep breath.
When pleurisy comes on independent of affection of the lung-substance,
it generally sets in suddenly with severe pain in the
chest, and a short hacking cough which causes so much pain
that the child tries as much as possible to suppress it. After a
few hours the severity of the pain usually subsides, but fever,
hurried breathing, and cough continue, and the child, though
usually it looks heavy and seems drowsy, yet becomes extremely
restless at intervals&mdash;cries and struggles as if in pain, and
violently resists any attempt to alter its position, since every
movement brings on an increase of its sufferings. The posture
which it selects varies much; sometimes its breathing seems
disturbed in any other position than sitting straight up in bed;
at other times it lies on its back, or one side; but whatever be
the posture, any alteration of it causes much distress, and is
sure to be resisted by the child.</p>

<p>The variations of posture depend on the seat of the inflammation;
the pain depends on the two inflamed surfaces
of the membrane rubbing against each other, and accordingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>is relieved not merely by the abatement of the inflammation,
but also when either the two surfaces become, as they often do,
adherent to each other, or when fluid is poured out into the
cavity of the chest, and thus keeps them asunder.</p>

<p>I dwell on this, because when fluid is poured out, the most
distressing symptoms greatly abate, or even disappear, and
parents sometimes put off in consequence sending for the
doctor, while yet, if unattended to, the fluid may increase to
so large a quantity as to press upon the lung, and so interfere
with the entrance of air, or it may, if the mischief is not
checked, change into matter, and then have to be let out by
tapping the chest, for just the same reason as it may be necessary
to open an abscess in any other situation.</p>

<p>Whenever, then, symptoms, such as I have described, come
on, send at once for medical advice, and do not let some
diminution of suffering, or slight general improvement, lead
you to delay.</p>

<p><b>Croup.</b>&mdash;I endeavoured to explain, a few pages back, the
cause of that peculiar sound which is heard in spasmodic
croup. The contraction of the opening of the windpipe
changes the sound which passes through it, just as the opening
or closing the keys of a wind instrument modifies the sound
which it gives forth. But the windpipe is not simply a wind
instrument, it is a stringed instrument too, and the strings or
vocal cords, as they are termed, give forth, as they vibrate,
tones now deeper, now more shrill. The action of this delicate
apparatus is readily disturbed, if the nerve-supply to it is disordered
by irritation in some distant organ, and then the
breathing is accompanied by the peculiar sound of spasmodic
croup, or in older children this may show itself in a different
way, as in the loud, barking cough heard in some cases of constipation,
or of disordered digestion; or another illustration of
it is furnished by the loud, long breath&mdash;the 'hoop,' which gives
its name to hooping-cough. But there is one sound that sometimes
attends the breathing of children, which more than any
other causes, and justly causes, the greatest anxiety to a mother;
and that is the sound which is characteristic of croup.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>The word croup, which comes from the Lowland Scotch,
signifies merely hoarseness in breathing or coughing, and is
therefore, strictly speaking, the name of a sign of disease,
rather than that of the disease itself. The peculiar sound is
heard in two different conditions&mdash;the one in which a child
having caught cold, instead of the air-tubes alone being
affected, the windpipe, and especially its upper part, becomes
congested, and the lining membrane swollen. Partly owing to
this, partly owing to its nerve-supply being disturbed, the child
breathes noisily and hoarsely, and the cough has a peculiar
metallic clangor. In the other case there is not merely the
congestion of the windpipe, the disturbed nerve-supply, and
the swollen state of the membrane; but in connection with
the influence of the special poison of diphtheria, a deposit
takes place at the back of the throat, whence it extends to the
windpipe, and in many instances even far beyond it, blocking
up its canal, and mechanically excluding the entrance of air.</p>

<p>To determine at once to which class a case of croup belongs
is so far from easy, that I should advise that on the first
sound of voice, or cough, or breathing resembling that of croup,
medical advice should at once be sought. I dwell on the
difference between the two: the first which has been called
false croup, or better catarrhal croup, and the second called
true croup, or diphtheritic croup, in order to save much needless
apprehension to parents, in whose mind the croupy sound
is invariably associated with nothing short of that most
dangerous disease&mdash;diphtheria.</p>

<p>As a general rule catarrhal croup is rarely met with after the
age of six. Children in whom it occurs have either seemed
quite well, or at most have been a little ailing for a day or two
with cold, and cough, and perhaps slight hoarseness. They go
to bed and fall asleep as usual, but the cough, which does not
wake them, becomes suddenly noisy, ringing, croupy, and the
breathing is speedily attended with a long-drawn sound, half-hissing,
half-ringing, and the child soon wakes alarmed, and
fighting for breath, the skin bathed in perspiration, the face
flushed and anxious. The cough, the difficult breathing, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>the struggle for air last for an hour or two, or sometimes all
night long, though they gradually subside, at any rate towards
the approach of morning, when the child falls asleep, and, but
for a somewhat hoarse sounding cough, and a look of fatigue,
there are but few signs of all that it has endured.</p>

<p>The attack may not return, or it may recur for two or three
successive nights, though in general with lessened severity, the
child during the daytime seeming to suffer only from a slight
cold, or now and then, and so rarely that I have not known it
to occur above once or twice in all my experience, it may end
in real inflammation of the windpipe; but not in diphtheria.</p>

<p>Attacks of this kind may recur three, four, or more times
even in childhood, while diphtheria has no tendency to recur,
but like measles or scarlatina seldom appears more than once,
though the rule is subject to more numerous exceptions than
are found in the case of the eruptive fevers. Still the fact of
an attack of this sort returning should of itself lessen apprehension
and make the parents look forward to its issue with less
anxiety than that with which they regarded its first occurrence.</p>

<p>A fact which shows how large a part is played by disturbance
of the nervous system in these cases is the liability of children
who have suffered from it to attacks of asthma, often of great
severity as they grow older, while very often after the transition
from childhood to youth has passed these attacks too lessen in
frequency and severity, and often altogether cease.</p>

<p>There are two measures which, while waiting for the doctor's
arrival, may at once be taken, and which sometimes remove
the symptoms almost as if by magic, while even were the case
one of diphtheria they would still be of some service, and
could not possibly do any harm. They are the hot bath, and
a full dose of ipecacuanha wine. The former should be as hot
as it can be borne, 93&deg; or 94&deg;, and the child should be kept in
it for five minutes, and the latter should be given in a full dose,
as a teaspoonful in warm water every quarter of an hour till
free vomiting takes place. How much better soever the child
may seem after the use of these remedies, it should still be kept
for two or three days under careful medical observation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p><p><b>Diphtheria.</b>&mdash;In <i>diphtheria</i> croup is only one, though the
most frequent, and one of the most serious, of the many
dangerous symptoms which attend it. The croupal symptoms
hardly ever come on quite suddenly, but are almost always preceded
for some days by slight feverishness, languor, and restlessness,
in spite of which the child still amuses itself; and if
too young to express its sensations, the slight degree of sore-throat
it experiences is manifested rather by a disinclination to
take food than by any obvious difficulty in swallowing. There
is no cough, nor any change of voice when the child is awake,
but when asleep&mdash;and the sleep is generally uneasy&mdash;it often
breathes with its mouth open, it snores slightly, or there is a
little hoarse sound accompanying the breathing owing to a
trivial swelling of the throat; while, if sought for, there will
generally be found a very little enlargement, and a very little
tenderness of the glands at the corner of the lower jaw. The
eyes are sometimes tearful, there may be slight running at the
nose, and the child is said to have a bad cold with slight sore-throat&mdash;the
most remarkable feature of the case being generally
that the depression of the patient is out of proportion to the
severity of the local ailment. If now the throat is examined&mdash;and
examination of the throat should never be omitted in any
case where there is the slightest difficulty of swallowing&mdash;nothing
may at first be seen but a very little swelling, and some redness
of one or other tonsil. In a few hours more, white specks like
little bits of curd will be seen first on one tonsil, then on the
other, and next these specks will have united to form one continuous
layer of a sort of yellowish-white membrane over the
palate and tonsils. The examination of the throat, often so
difficult when children are ill, is attended with almost none, if
while they are well they have been taught the little trick of
opening their mouths to show their throat, and of allowing the
introduction of a spoon to keep down the tongue, a proceeding
which though certainly unpleasant they will almost always readily
agree to, like Martha Trapbois, in the 'Fortunes of Nigel,' 'for
a consideration.' The deposit on the throat may disappear of
its own accord, and not be reproduced, and this even though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>no treatment has been adopted, and in two or three days the
child may be pretty well again, though strength is in general
regained less rapidly than might have been expected from
the comparative mildness of the attack.</p>

<p>In cases so slight it is no easy matter to recognise the
features of a highly dangerous disease; still, out of forerunners
so trivial as these, croupal symptoms may be developed, and
their advances may be most insidious, and unless both parents
and doctor have been closely on the watch they may be surprised
all at once by the breathing suddenly becoming very
laboured, by that and the cough becoming attended by the
sounds characteristic of croup, and by the child's life being
in extreme jeopardy, or in danger even beyond the hope of
recovery.</p>

<p>It is not that here, as in cases of catarrhal croup, the ailment
has really come on suddenly, but that the disease has been silently
making unsuspected progress. Whenever then a child, after a
few days of slight causeless ailing, accompanied with some little
discomfort in swallowing, is seen to have white patches at the
back of its throat, do not allow yourselves to be lulled even by
their disappearance into a feeling of absolute security. Watch
the child, and beg the doctor to watch it carefully, until it is
perfectly well again, for though the deposit may have disappeared
from the back of the throat it may continue to be
formed in the windpipe, and in the somewhat depressed state of
the nervous system which attends diphtheria it may not excite
that irritation which any such cause would produce in a child
in perfect health, and consequently not announce its presence
until its amount has become so considerable as to offer an
almost insurmountable obstacle to the entrance of air. Any,
even the slightest, hurry of breathing, a hissing sound when the
child draws its breath, hoarseness of voice, or a ringing cough,
should quicken your apprehension of danger, and make you
seek for immediate help.</p>

<p>It may be as well, however, to mention here, that not every
white speck seen at the back of the throat is of necessity due
to diphtheria, but that in some cases of ordinary sore-throat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>white spots may form on the surface of the tonsils. These
white spots are due to the collection at their openings of the
secretion formed in the minute glands which beset the surface
of the tonsils, and which at these seasons is poured out in
greater abundance than usual. They are distinct from each
other, and do not coalesce into a membrane; the surface
beneath is not the uniform red shining surface on which the
membrane in diphtheria has formed, but the separate tiny
openings from which the white matter has exuded may be distinctly
seen if the surface is wiped with a camel's-hair brush.
It is, of course, wise in every case to leave to the doctor the
decision as to the nature of the deposit, but it may sometimes
relieve needless anxiety to know beforehand that there is another
cause besides diphtheria to which white spots at the back of
the throat may be due.</p>

<p>There are other dangers, indeed, besides those arising from
croup, which accompany diphtheria, though those just mentioned
are of all the most frequent. There are cases in which death
takes place not from the severity of any local ailment, but from
the intense depression of the nervous system. There are other
instances too, in which the case assumes what is termed a
malignant character; profuse discharge taking place from the
nostrils, swallowing being from the first exceedingly difficult,
membrane being deposited on the lips, behind the ears, or at
the edge of the bowel; death taking place in twenty-four or
thirty-six hours from the outset of the first serious symptoms,
either in convulsions, or from utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>But the very urgency of such cases must of necessity call
for the immediate assistance of the doctor; and my business
throughout this book is rather with those points which it is
important for a mother to notice, and those things which it
behoves her to do.</p>

<p>What does diphtheria depend on? is a question more easily
asked than answered. The disease is contagious, as scarlatina
is contagious, though not to the same degree. I may add, it is
not identical with scarlatina, nor does the one disease protect
from the other. It would, perhaps, be too much to say that it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>is dependent on an unsanitary condition of a town, a village, or
a house, but there is no doubt but that, as is the case with
cholera, scarlet-fever, or typhus, unsanitary conditions favour
its spread, and increase its severity.</p>

<p>Being contagious, it is most important to keep cups, glasses,
spoons, towels, and bed-linen separate from those of other inmates
of the house, and to remove the patient from any room
occupied by other children. Great care too is to be observed,
if anyone is standing over the child during a fit of coughing,
that none of the membrane which it spits up enters the mouth;
and, that if the child's breath is caught, the attendant gargle
immediately with a teaspoonful of Condy's fluid in a tumbler of
water.</p>

<p>In the next place, as the depression of the nervous system
in some cases of diphtheria is quite out of proportion to the
local disease, and as children who have not seemed very suffering,
have yet been known to die suddenly in an unexpected
faint, it is of moment that the child remain constantly in bed
from the commencement of the attack till complete convalescence.
Nor, indeed, in serious cases is even this precaution
sufficient; but in such circumstances not only must the child
not be taken out of bed for any purpose, but it must even not
be suddenly raised in bed, from a recumbent to a sitting posture.
I have, on several occasions, known the neglect of these
precautions followed immediately by what cannot but be regarded
as the needless death of the patient.</p>

<p>During the illness, there is little for the mother to do, except
to try to carry out the doctor's directions, and to give the child
constantly little bits of ice to suck, which lessen the swelling of
the throat, and relieve the pain and inflammation. If the child
knows how to gargle, it should be induced to do so constantly,
and finding the relief which this affords, will do so very readily.
This is not the time, however, when the lesson 'how to gargle'
can be learnt. A thoughtful mother teaches it while the child
is well, and if the gargle is composed of raspberry vinegar and
water, the lesson is learnt without tears. There comes a time,
however, if the disease is at all severe, when gargling is no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>longer possible, for the muscles of the back of the throat lose
their power; but now some medicated solution, employed by
means of the spray-producer, may most efficiently take its
place.</p>

<p>When croupal symptoms have gone on growing worse and
worse, and the child is in the agonies of suffocation, the doctor
may propose to open the windpipe, in the hope of giving the
child another chance of recovery, and even though the operation
fail, of at least lessening its sufferings.</p>

<p>The operation is sometimes objected to by the parents, on
the ground of the uncertainty of the result, and the torture of
the operation to the child. Now the anguish of a child dying
of croup is due to two causes; first, the actual mechanical
impediment to the entrance of air produced by the deposit in
the windpipe, and secondly, to the spasm of the muscles in the
upper part of the windpipe which that deposit produces. How
large an amount of distress the latter may produce, anyone can
judge for himself, to whom it has ever happened to swallow the
wrong way, as it is called. The opening made below the seat
of the muscles which close the windpipe, leaves them in perfect
rest, and does away with all the suffering produced by
spasm, while there is always a fair prospect if the operation
is not put off too long, of the deposit being limited to the
part above the artificial opening, and of the good being permanent.</p>

<p>It is true that we have no certain means of knowing the
extent of the deposit beforehand; it is true also that the operation
is not in itself a cure of the disease, but at any rate, it is a
reprieve which gives time for remedies to take effect, and at the
worst, it substitutes a comparatively painless death for one of
intolerable anguish. It can, too, be performed under the influence
of chloroform, so that the idea that it adds in any way
to the child's distress is unfounded. Who that has seen the
calm, happy face, and watched the tranquil sleep of the child
after the operation, who before was struggling, with distorted
features and agonised countenance, to get a breath of air, but
would feel as I do, that I would have it done in a child of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>mine for the sake of a painless death, even though I knew for
certain that it would not prolong life even for an hour?</p>

<p>One additional remark I have to make with reference to the
loss of power, or palsy of various muscles, which frequently follows
diphtheria. Almost always there is some impairment of
power in the muscles of the throat on which the deposit had
taken place, and there is, in consequence, a little difficulty in
swallowing for a few days. If this should get worse, food and
especially drink sometimes return by the nose, and next there
may be a slight squint, and the sight may become weakened,
and an uncertain tottering gait; and sometimes for a week or
two the child may be unable even to stand. In bad cases
there is with these symptoms a general loss of nervous as well
as of muscular power, though the child may still be fairly cheerful,
and ready to amuse itself as well as it can. This condition
may last for many weeks before it passes quite away, and if
under the mistaken impression that the limbs will gain strength
by exercise, the child is allowed to sit up and encouraged to
exert itself, recovery will be delayed much longer; and dangerous
weakness or fatal exhaustion may suddenly come on.</p>

<p>The inference is too obvious for me to need dwell on it,
that repose is the great resource, and quiet waiting the true
wisdom.</p>

<p><b>Hooping-Cough.</b>&mdash;I need not say much about <i>hooping-cough</i>,
for there is scarcely a nursery in which, to everyone's great
discomfort, it is not known as a familiar and most unwelcome
visitant. It varies remarkably in its importance, being sometimes
so slight as scarcely to amount to an illness, but in other
instances one of the most deadly of diseases. It causes the
death of a fourth of all children who die under the age of five,
and three out of four of these deaths take place in infants of
less than two years old.</p>

<p>It occurs, however, comparatively seldom during the first
three or four months of life, probably because very young children
are kept more at home than others, and are thus less exposed
to catch it. Though hooping-cough is undoubtedly very
contagious, it seems to be communicated only by the breath,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>and there is absolutely no evidence to show that the clothes of
a child suffering from hooping-cough can carry the infection as
they might were the child suffering from measles, or smallpox,
or scarlet-fever; still less that a person who has visited a room
where children are suffering from hooping-cough can convey
the disease to another house, or to other children.</p>

<p>The disease derives its name, as everyone knows, from the
peculiar sound which attends the cough, and which is due, as is
the sound of croup, to spasm of the upper part of the windpipe.
It is equally characterised by the cough returning in fits or
paroxysms, which end in a long-drawn breath, attended by the
hoop. An occasional sound like a hoop, in a young child who
has a cold, is not so conclusive of a case being one of hooping-cough
as is the recurrence of the cough in fits; for until teething
is completed, slight and temporary irritation will suffice to
produce a passing spasm of the upper part of the windpipe.</p>

<p>An ordinary attack of hooping-cough begins like a common
cold, but as the little ailment passes off, the cough still
continues, the fits of coughing become more frequent, last
longer, grow severer and more suffocative, and end with the
loud long breath, the hoop; while sometimes no sooner is one
fit over than another follows it almost immediately, and quiet
breathing does not return until the child is tired out by its
efforts. Nevertheless, the child's health continues fairly good,
and little or nothing ails it during the intervals of the cough.
For about a fortnight the cough usually goes on to increase; and
during this time the night attacks especially become more frequent.
It then for a week or ten days continues stationary,
and then declines, a diminution in the frequency and severity
of the night attacks being in general the first sign of amendment,
and at the end of six weeks from the beginning of the
attack the child is in general quite convalescent. Even then,
however, a trifling cause will reproduce the characteristic cough
for a few days, and not seldom for many months afterwards any
cold which the child may catch will be attended by a paroxysmal
cough undistinguishable save by its milder character and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>shorter duration from the previous hooping-cough, though I
believe incapable of communicating that disease.</p>

<p>In mild hooping-cough there is little or nothing to be
done, save to follow the dictates of common sense, and not
to neglect them in quest of some imaginary specific&mdash;some
vaunted medicine which is said to be a certain cure; or such
as shutting up the child in a room the atmosphere of which
is charged with the vapour of tar, or of carbolic acid, or of
sulphur.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly impressed on the minds of parents
that there is no specific whatever for hooping-cough; no
remedy which will cut it short, as quinine cuts short a fit of
ague. The domestic treatment of mild hooping-cough is
the domestic treatment of a common cold, implying the same
precautions as to the equal temperature of the day and night
nursery, the little doses of ipecacuanha at night, but as seldom
as possible during the day, in order not to interfere with the
appetite and digestion, together with special care to insure the
regular action of the bowels. It sometimes happens that after
a week or two the severer fits of coughing are followed by
vomiting; and the child may lose flesh and strength from inability
to retain its food. In these circumstances food must be
given, little in quantity, at short intervals, and of a kind that
need not remain long in the stomach in order to be digested.
Good soup, beef-tea, milk, rice milk, or a raw egg beaten up in
milk, and biscuit rather than bread, must take the place of the
ordinary meals, and be given twice as often.</p>

<p>The different liniments, and the favourite Roche's Embrocation,
are of use when the disease is on the decline, and may
also be of service if bronchitis should occur to complicate the
hooping-cough, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>Change of air when hooping-cough is on the decline is
often of great service, and change even from good air to one
less good appears to be sometimes of use; but change in the
early stages, or when hooping-cough has become really severe,
is but adding another to the already existing dangers.</p>

<p>The danger in hooping-cough arises through the medium
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>either of the head or of the lungs, and through each of them
with about equal frequency. The head becomes affected in
consequence of the often recurring congestion of the brain,
produced, as in spasmodic croup, by the constantly returning
interruption to the breathing. In these cases the cough is
frequent, and so violent that the child becomes livid during
each paroxysm, and that instead of ending in a loud hoop
it finishes by a fit of convulsions or by the child sinking into
a state of semi-insensibility. Increased violence of the cough,
with suppression of the hoop, is always a bad omen in
hooping-cough.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the cough becomes complicated
with bronchitis, it ceases to recur in distinct fits which leave
behind them intervals of comparative, or of absolute ease.
The hurried breathing which precedes and follows a fit of
coughing never entirely subsides, while each returning cough
aggravates the irritation and inflammation of the air-tubes, and
the child's condition becomes the very dangerous one of hooping-cough
complicated with bronchitis.</p>

<p>So long as a child seems pretty well in the intervals between
the fits of coughing, as the hurried breathing subsides after
each to a natural frequency, as a long loud hoop follows each
cough, as vomiting takes place only after a fit of coughing and
never in the intervals, as the child becomes flushed only and
not livid during a cough, and recovers itself perfectly afterwards,
as it does not complain of constant headache, nor spits
blood, nor has nose-bleeding, nor is feverish, nor depressed,
nor drowsy, you may feel happy about it. When any of the
symptoms just enumerated show themselves you have reason
for grave solicitude, and the child requires daily medical
watching.</p>

<p>One word in conclusion. A child who has recently had
hooping-cough is more liable than another to be attacked by
chicken-pox or measles; and, moreover, imperfect recovery
from hooping-cough is apt, especially if there is any tendency
to consumption in the family, to be followed by consumptive
disease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span><b>Asthma.</b>&mdash;<i>Asthma</i>, attended by distress of breathing quite
as considerable as in the grown person, is by no means unusual
in the child. Recovery from it is far more likely to take place
in the latter, since it is almost always independent of those
diseases of the heart or lungs, which in the former occasion or
aggravate it. It belongs to the class of what has been termed
nervous asthma and is observed with special frequency in
children who, when younger, had been liable to catarrhal
croup; spasm of the air-tubes having taken the place of the
previous spasm of the windpipe. Independently of that
antecedent it comes on sometimes about the time of the second
teething in nervous and impressionable children, in whom an
attack may be produced by indigestion, constipation, or over-fatigue.
It is also by no means rare in children in whom that
skin affection, eczema, of which I have already spoken, outlasts
the time of infancy, and becomes general and severe.
The improper performance of the functions of the skin seems
to cause a peculiar sensitiveness of the air-tubes, and to render
them liable to the occasional occurrence of that spasm which
produces asthma. These cases are less hopeful than others,
and the liability to the attacks ceases only when the skin-affection
has been completely cured; a reason this for not
neglecting eczema in infancy and early childhood. Sometimes,
too, it follows frequently-recurring attacks of bronchitis, and,
though less often than might be expected, it succeeds severe
hooping-cough, and in these two conditions the prospects of
recovery are less hopeful than in the others.</p>

<p>When asthma occurs in childhood, the first point is to
ascertain the cause on which the attack depends; and it is
worth any amount of care to discover and remove it; for if
what may be called the asthmatic habit is not formed, the
attacks will, in the majority of instances, cease between the
ages of twelve and fifteen. Bad habits of the body are, however,
as difficult to get rid of as bad habits of the mind, and
the boy who grows up an asthmatic youth is very unlikely to
get rid of the disorder in later life.</p>

<p>It is in that form of asthma which succeeds to frequent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>attacks of catching cold, and in which bronchitis precedes or
accompanies each seizure, that change of climate is most
useful. In the majority of instances a moderately sheltered
seaside place, with a sandy soil such as Bournemouth, is the
best, and a few years' residence there not infrequently overcomes
every disposition to asthma through the whole remainder
of the patient's life. To this, however, there are exceptions,
and I have seen instances in which residence at Bournemouth
and in the Riviera have failed, but where a perfect cure has
been wrought by the cold, still air of Davos.</p>

<p><b>Diseases of the Heart.</b>&mdash;<b>Malformed Heart.</b>&mdash;Every
now and then one sees a little babe, carefully wrapped up in
its nurse's arms to shield it, even on a warm day, from the air;
and, on removing the shawl which covered it, one is struck by
the sight of a little pale pinched face, with a livid ring around
the mouth, and a blue instead of a rosy tint of lips and fingertips,
as though perished with cold. The babe wakes on being
disturbed, and gives a faint short cry of distress; the livid hue
of its surface deepens, it struggles feebly, its mouth twitches
as though convulsions might be coming on. Soon, however,
these symptoms subside, the babe smiles again, is cheerful, and
save for the tints of its face and lips, it looks like other infants,
but frailer.</p>

<p>This condition has a name in medical writings, from a
Greek word expressive of the blue tint which characterises it,
and is called <i>cyanosis</i>. It depends on the blood not having
undergone completely those changes in the lungs which take
place in the healthy state. The blood, as it returns through
the veins to the right side of the heart, is of a deep purple hue.
The right side of the heart contracting sends it to the lungs,
where, in the minute vessels of the air-cells, it is purified, and
returns vivified by the oxygen a bright scarlet stream, to be
distributed by the arteries over the whole body; and thence to
return once more for fresh purification to the right side of the
heart. Before birth, the blood does not run the same course,
but is purified within the mother's body, the blood running
through channels which close with the first breath the infant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>draws. The previously existing communication between the
two sides of the heart ceases at the same time as the new
channels are opened, by the shutting of a thin valve which
had hitherto allowed the blood to pass from one side to the
other.</p>

<p>Sometimes this closure fails to take place, or takes place but
imperfectly; sometimes, in addition, the channels which should
be disused after birth remain open still; and sometimes also
the heart is otherwise imperfectly formed, and a large communication
exists between the two sides of the heart, which long
before birth ought to have been firmly partitioned off from each
other.</p>

<p>According to the freedom of communication between the
two sides of the heart, there is more or less ready intermingling
of the impure blood with that which is already purified; and
this is betokened by the greater or less severity of the symptoms
which I have described. When the heart is very malformed,
and the blood consequently is very impure, life is but
a short agony which ends in a few weeks; some slight movement,
some little accidental cold deranging altogether the
imperfect machinery, and bringing it to a sudden standstill.
Between this and the slightest cases there are all shades of
difference, till, in the latter, a smaller power to maintain
warmth, a less rapid growth, a smaller muscular development,
a feebler power, a hurry of breathing on exertion, or in ascending
a hill, or in going up a staircase, are all, except the sounds
which the educated ear detects of the blood passing through
its devious course, that tell of nature having, in this instance,
ill done her handiwork.</p>

<p>The one most natural question to which, in every instance,
the doctor has to reply is this: 'Will he or she outgrow it?'
To this the answer is, '<i>Yes</i>,' and '<i>No</i>.' In the worst cases the
answer is obviously <i>no</i>; and in none does <i>yes</i> imply a recovery
so complete as to leave no trace behind, and to make the child
heartwhole. But short of this, in many instances much may
be hoped for. There is, as I shall have occasion again to
repeat, a power in the growing heart to adapt itself in large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>measure to conditions other than those of perfect health. The
channels, through which the blood ought not to flow, may shrink
though they may not entirely close; the valve may shut more
completely than at first the opening between the two sides of
the heart; all inconveniences may lessen, and the child may at
last become scarcely aware of the difference between himself
and others. But for any such result, or for anything approaching
it to be attained, certain conditions are absolutely essential
which it is seldom easy to induce parents to observe. Whatever
can hurry the circulation is most carefully to be avoided. The
child must be kept strictly out of the way of hooping-cough,
measles, or any other fever; must be shielded from every risk
of catching cold, and having smaller power of maintaining its
warmth than others have, must be specially warmly clad, and
must live in rooms at a temperature of 60 deg. Fahr., all the
year round. Great attention must be paid to the state of the
bowels, so that constipation may not necessitate violent efforts
to relieve them.</p>

<p>Moreover, for years the child must be carried upstairs; when
old enough to take part in games, it must not be allowed to join
in any which call for violent exertion, such as cricket, or lawn
tennis, nor ride any other than a quiet pony at a gentle
pace.</p>

<p>It depends entirely on the parents whether, for the sake of
a very great but far-off good, they will strictly observe these
rules. The difficulty will not arise on the child's part, for it is
not hard for those who have had charge of it from babyhood
to bring it up to quiet pursuits and quiet amusements, till it
seeks no others, and, like the little cage-bred bird, does not care
to emulate the flight of others stronger on the wing.</p>

<p><b>Inflammation of the Heart.</b>&mdash;The above remarks do
not comprise all that is to be said about heart-affection in early
life. <i>Inflammation</i> may attack the investing or the lining membrane
of the heart at all ages, may produce in the child the same
suffering as in the grown person, and may tend to destroy life
in a similar manner. The causes, indeed, which produce heart
disease, are far more frequent in the grown person than in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>child, and advancing age brings with it changes which, wholly
apart from active inflammation, produce grave forms of disease
unknown in early life. There is, however, one cause of heart
disease which is far more frequent in childhood and early youth
than in later life, namely, rheumatism. Eight out of ten of all
cases of heart disease under the age of fifteen are of rheumatic
origin, and in eighteen out of twenty cases of acute rheumatism
under that age, whether slight or severe, the heart becomes
more or less involved. Now and then, though rarely, the heart
becomes affected in the course of scarlatina, and still more
seldom in the course of the other fevers, and every now and
then affection of the heart is associated with some other form
of inflammation of the chest.</p>

<p>Pain is by no means a constant attendant on it, but fever,
more or less considerable, a quickened pulse, and hurried
breathing are all but invariable, and one great reason for seeking
the immediate help of the doctor is, that his skilled ear may
at once detect by the altered sounds the heart-affection at its
very outset, and employ the measures calculated to arrest its
progress.</p>

<p>Death in the acute stage of a first attack of inflammation of
the heart is of extreme rarity, but the damaged heart is liable to
returns of acute mischief, any one of which may prove fatal.
Independently of this, life with diseased heart is one of suffering,
attended as it is by symptoms similar in kind, though not
identical with those which I have already mentioned as attendant
on malformation of the organ.</p>

<p>The hopeful element, however, to which I have already
referred as present in cases of malformed heart, exists here in
even a greater degree; since repair of injury is possible, while
the reconstitution of an organ faulty from birth is obviously
beyond nature's power.</p>

<p>I can but repeat the directions already given as to the importance
of allowing the heart as much rest, and giving it as
little work, as is possible with a never-resting organ; and this
with the added motive for perseverance furnished by the happy
issue which may be hoped for as its reward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>One word I must add about the occasional occurrence
of <i>irregular action of the heart</i> during the years of growth,
especially from the age of ten to fourteen. This is often quite
independent of any disease, and ceases when with added
strength the nervous system becomes less impressionable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>DISEASES OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION.</h3>


<p><b>Manner of Performance of Digestion.</b>&mdash;The organs
situated in what is called in medical language the abdomen,
have in the child no other duty to perform than such as subserve
the processes of digestion and nutrition. The saliva
secreted by the appropriate glands in the mouth, mixing with
the food, facilitates the further changes which take place in the
stomach. In the stomach the food is acted on and dissolved
by the gastric juice or pepsin, which is poured out by an almost
infinity of minute tubes, or follicles as they are termed. When
the stomach has done its work, its contents in a semi-fluid state
pass into the small intestine, and mix there with the bile, the
secretions from the intestines themselves, and with those of the
large gland, the pancreas (in culinary language known as the
sweetbread), which seems to have the special power of dissolving
fatty matters. As the food, thus acted on, travels along the
intestines, whose constant movement facilitates the passage of
their contents from above downwards, its elements are taken up,
partly by the blood-vessels, partly by innumerable small vessels,
called absorbents from their power of imbibing fluids, and
lacteals, from the milky hue of the fluid within them when first
absorbed. The fluid taken up by the blood-vessels is conveyed
to the liver; that taken up by the absorbents to the mesenteric
glands, and in these organs further changes take place in it, which
fit it to be received into the mass of the circulating fluid. With
this it is carried to the right side of the heart, and thence to
the lungs and, lastly, from them to the left side of the heart,
whence it is distributed, the great life and health giver, to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>rest of the body. The useless inconvertible material, leaving
every available element behind, is got rid of, either in a solid
form by the bowels, or in a fluid form by the kidneys; and
thus as long as life lasts there goes on more or less perfectly the
wonderful process of constant change, of constant renewal, and
during childhood and youth, of constant increase of size and
stature.</p>

<p>Incomplete as this sketch is, it may yet suggest how readily
one part of this complex machinery may be thrown out of gear,
and further how not one part can suffer without all being disordered.
Solid food given to the child before it has cut its
teeth, enters the stomach unreduced to pulp by the grinders,
and unmixed with the saliva, which should help its solution,
and which the undeveloped salivary glands do not yet furnish.
Too large a quantity of food, or food of an unsuitable character,
on which the gastric juice cannot act readily, may pass into a
state of fermentation; vomiting, flatulence, sour and offensive
breath will be the result, and the food will pass into the intestine
unprepared to be acted on by the bile. Exposure to cold,
or the opposite condition of excessive heat, may disturb the
action of the liver, and interfere with the secretion of bile;
and the food will then pass along the intestine in a state
unsuitable for absorption. Or, again, the mesenteric glands
may be irritated by long-continued imperfect performance of
the earlier stages of digestion, or their structure may be altered,
and mesenteric disease, or consumption of the bowels, as it has
been termed, may result. From want of muscular power, or
from want of care on their part who have charge of the child,
the bowels may become habitually constipated. Health will
then suffer, if the child carries about with it for days together
matters which can serve no useful purpose, but which are to
the body what an ill-kept dustbin is to the rest of the house.
Lastly, if the kidneys perform their duties imperfectly in consequence
of exposure to cold, or of the changes which some
diseases, such as scarlatina, sometimes bring about in their
structure, the blood will be imperfectly purified; dropsy and
various forms of inflammation may result; or the brain and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>nervous system may be disordered, and death in convulsions
may attest the dangerous nature of this blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>It would take too long to go in detail through all the phases
of disordered digestion in early life. Much has been already
anticipated in a former part of this book, especially with reference
to the troubles of digestion in infancy and early childhood.
There is, indeed, but one form of indigestion whose characters
are so special as to require that I should enter into any detail
with reference to it.</p>

<p><b>Dyspepsia of Weakly Children.</b>&mdash;Children from the
age of about three to ten years, whose health has been impaired
by an attack of typhoid, or, as it is commonly called, infantile
remittent fever, or who belong to a weakly family, or to one,
some of whose members have shown a disposition to consumptive
disease, are sometimes martyrs to indigestion. It does not
need with them any special error of diet, or any casual exposure
to cold to disorder their digestion; but every two or three
weeks, even under the most scrupulous care, they lose their
appetite, their tongue becomes thickly coated with yellow fur,
their breath offensive, their bowels constipated, the evacuations
being either very white or very dark, and frequently lumpy,
and coated with a thin layer of mucus from the bowel, which
also appears in shreds at the bottom of the utensil. With this
condition, too, there is some, though not considerable, feverishness,
and the urine becomes turbid on cooling, and throws
down a reddish-white deposit, which disappears if heated. At
the end of two or three days of rest in bed, of a diet of beef-tea
and milk, with no solid food, with simple saline medicines,
mild aperients, and perhaps a single small dose of calomel, the
symptoms pass off; but return again and again at uncertain
intervals, and without any obvious cause.</p>

<p>In these cases, the children almost always, when in their
ordinary health, have a peculiar patchy condition of the tongue,
one part of it being covered with a thin white coating, through
which little red points project, while another part is of a vivid
red, and looks raw and shining, as though it had been scalded,
while the red points, or the papill&aelig;, as they are termed, project
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>above its surface like so many pins' heads. Children in whom
this condition exists, require much watching and much care. I
have dwelt upon it in order to impress on parents the conviction
that it is not a state to be cured, once for all, even by the most
skilful doctor, but that years are needed to eradicate a bad
habit of the body, as much as to cure a bad habit of the mind.</p>

<p><b>Jaundice.</b>&mdash;I have already spoken of the jaundice of new-born
infants; but a sluggish condition of the liver, accompanied
by very white or pale evacuations, constipation, and loss of appetite,
with a sallow tint of the skin, and sometimes even with
actual <i>jaundice</i>, are by no means uncommon during the first ten
years of childhood. Neither condition is serious; that of actual
jaundice occurs mostly in the summer, and is then connected
with the sudden onset of hot weather. When severe, it may
be associated with some degree of feverishness, with dizziness,
and complaint of headache, and occasionally with vomiting,
while the child rests ill at night, or awakes in a state of alarm,
and these symptoms sometimes give rise to the fear that the
child is about to be attacked by water on the brain. But the
following consideration may serve to calm anxiety on that score.
The attack is not preceded, as water on the brain is almost
invariably, by several days or even weeks of failing health. It
is not attended by heat of head, nor by intolerance of light,
nor by constant nausea; and the belly is full rather than
shrunken. When to these symptoms are added tenderness on
the right side, high-coloured urine and white evacuations, you
may set your mind at rest, even before the yellow colour of the
skin, which appears in a day or two, stamps the case unmistakably
as one of jaundice.</p>

<p>My business is, as I have said more than once, the endeavour
to describe the symptoms of disease, to explain their
nature, to indicate the principles to be observed in attempting
their cure, and not to lay down definite rules for their treatment,
with the idle expectation that I could thus enable every
mother to be her children's doctor.</p>

<p><b>Diarrh&oelig;a.</b>&mdash;I have, therefore, comparatively little to say
about <i>diarrh&oelig;a</i> in children, important though it is, for its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>symptoms force themselves on the notice even of the least
observant. There are, however, a few points concerning it
worth bearing in mind. Before the commencement of teething,
diarrh&oelig;a is almost always the result of premature weaning,
or of a diet in some respect or other unsuitable. As soon as
teething begins, the liability to diarrh&oelig;a increases greatly, and
cases of it are more than twice as frequent, and twice as fatal,
between the ages of six and eighteen months as they were in
the first six months of life; while, as soon as teething is over,
their number immediately declines again to the half of what
it was during the continuance of that process. The practical
conclusions to be drawn from these facts are that looseness of
the bowels during teething is not a desirable occurrence to be
promoted, as some mistakenly imagine, but a risk to be by all
means avoided, and I may add, when it does take place, far
less easy to control than constipation is to remedy. And next,
that in order to prevent its occurrence, care should be taken
to make changes in the diet of a child, not during the time
when a fresh eruption of teeth is taking place, but during one
of the pauses in that process. There are certain seasons of the
year when diarrh&oelig;a is specially prevalent, independent of any
change in diet, or alteration, in any respect, of the circumstances
in which the child is placed. Thus, in May, June, and
July, diarrh&oelig;a is twice as prevalent among children at all ages
as in November, December, and January; and in August,
September, and October, its prevalence is three times as great
as during the winter months. The high mortality of children
in the summer months is due almost entirely to diarrh&oelig;a, and
even the bitter Northern winter of a city like Berlin is a third
less fatal to infants and young children than the heat of its
short summer.</p>

<p>The next point to remember is that mere looseness of the
bowels is never to be regarded during the first three years of
life as of no importance; for I have seen infants die exhausted
from its continuance, even though the examination of the body
after death showed almost no sign of disease. Doctors distinguish
two forms of diarrh&oelig;a: the simple, or, as it is technically
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>called, catarrhal diarrh&oelig;a; and inflammatory diarrh&oelig;a, or
dysentery. The one may pass into the other, just as a common
cold, or catarrh, may pass, if unattended to, into a dangerous
bronchitis.</p>

<p><i>Simple diarrh&oelig;a</i> usually comes on gradually, and is some
days before it grows severe, or passes into the more dangerous
dysentery. Simple precautions will often arrest its progress,
and, among them, rest in bed is one of the most important.
Over and over again I have known a diarrh&oelig;a which had continued
in spite of all sorts of medicines so long as the child
was running about, cease at once when the child was kept for
a couple of days in bed. The reason of this is obvious; constant
movement of the intestines themselves, which serves so
important a part in maintaining due action of the bowels, is
increased by the upright position and by movement, and is
reduced to a minimum by the horizontal position. A second
precaution concerns the diet; solid food and animal broths
should for a time be discontinued, and arrowroot, milk and
water, and rice substituted for it, for a day or two, with isinglass
jelly, and the white decoction of which I have already
spoken. It is not always that astringents are suitable at the
beginning of an attack, and the sending to the neighbouring
chemist for diarrh&oelig;a medicine, which often contains an unknown
quantity of opium, is always risky, frequently mischievous.
In a first attack of diarrh&oelig;a, the doctor should always be consulted,
for when it is associated with disorder of the liver a
mercurial may in the first instance be needed, or possibly very
small doses of a saline medicine, such as Epsom salts, with the
addition of a few drops of the tincture of rhubarb; or, again,
if the diarrh&oelig;a sets in with profuse watery discharges, sulphuric
acid for the first few hours is often of extreme service.
It is at a later time that direct astringents commonly have
their use; and the mother, who in her child's first attack of
diarrh&oelig;a has had the advice of a judicious doctor, will often
be helped by him to manage for herself slight returns of the
ailment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span><i>Inflammatory diarrh&oelig;a</i>, or dysentery, not only follows the
continuance of the simpler forms of the disease, but sometimes
in the hot months of summer or autumn sets in suddenly
with violence. It then frequently commences with vomiting,
and the stomach may continue so irritable for twenty-four
hours as not to retain even a teaspoonful of cold water. At
the same time the over-action of the bowels sets in, and twenty
or thirty evacuations may be passed in twenty-four hours. The
motions soon lose their natural character, and become watery,
slimy, and mixed with blood. They are at first expelled with
violence, afterwards with much pain, effort, and often fruitless
straining. With these local symptoms, the child, as might be
expected, is very ill, feverish, and stupid, though without sound
sleep, much exhausted, and its nervous system so disturbed as
to occasion frequent twitchings of the fingers and of the corners
of the mouth, while sometimes actual convulsions take place.
The thirst is intense, the child calling constantly for cold water,
and crying out for more the moment the cup is taken away
from its lips; while the loss of flesh and the exhaustion are
more rapid than in any other disease with which I am acquainted.
The fat happy babe of four and twenty hours before
is scarcely to be recognised in the miserable little being, with
sunken lustreless eyes, and wizened features, and miserable
countenance, lying in a state of half-stupor, sensible only to
pain, which yet rouses it but to utter a moan, and then sinks
again into silent suffering. I can well believe what we are told,
that in some countries this, the so-called Summer Complaint
of many of the American cities, sometimes carries off children
in a few hours.</p>

<p>If a fatal termination does not take place speedily, the
disease passes into the chronic stage, the diarrh&oelig;a diminishing
in frequency, but the pain and straining, and the unhealthy
character of the evacuations persisting. Ulceration of the
bowels has taken place, emaciation becomes extreme, and the
child often sinks at the end of several weeks, worn out by
suffering; while recovery, doubtful at the best, is always very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>slow. But I need not pursue this subject further: enough has
already been said to show how little infantile diarrh&oelig;a is a disorder
for domestic management.</p>

<p><b>Peritonitis</b>, or inflammation of the membrane covering
the bowels and lining the cavity of the belly, is of excessive
rarity in its acute form; and is attended by such general illness
and such severe local suffering, that it is impossible to overlook
it or to misapprehend its gravity. Severe pain in the belly is
sometimes complained of by children, and is due to what is
termed colic, a spasm of the bowels which is generally associated
with constipation. The great test of the cause of the
pain is furnished by the presence or absence of tenderness on
pressure. The pain of colic is relieved by gentle pressure and
gentle rubbing. The pain of inflammation in any degree and
of any kind is aggravated by them. This applies also to cases,
not indeed very common, in which inflammation is set up by
some small body, such as a cherry-stone getting fixed in a little
offshoot or appendage of about the size and length of the little
finger, connected with the commencement of the large bowel,
and producing ulceration. In these circumstances the bowels
are confined, there are nausea and sickness, together with pain
and tenderness of the belly, especially on the right side. The
disease is a very dangerous one, and often proves fatal in the
course of a few days. I refer to it because I have often seen
it overlooked both by parents and doctors at its outset, since
the pain then is often not severe nor the tenderness intense,
and because I have seen the patient's condition rendered
hopeless by strong aperients being given to overcome the constipation
which was supposed to be all that ailed the child.
I repeat then the caution, never to overlook the existence
of tenderness, never to attempt to treat a case in which it is
present; but always to call in medical advice, and above all
always to abstain, unless ordered by a medical man, in every
such case from the use of aperients.</p>

<p><b>Large Abdomen.</b>&mdash;I must not leave the subject of disorder
of the digestive organs without some reference to a
condition which often excites much needless anxiety among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>mothers, namely, the large size of a child's belly. This is
sometimes supposed to be a certain evidence of the presence
of worms, at other times to be a positive proof of the existence
of grave disease, especially of disease of the mesenteric glands,
or glands of the bowels as they are popularly termed. It is
evidence of neither the one nor the other.</p>

<p>If you go into a gallery of the old masters, and look at any
of the pictures of angels which are generally to be seen there
in such abundance, you will probably be struck in the case of
all the child angels by what will seem to you the undue size of
their abdomen. You will notice this even in the works of
painters who, like Raphael, most idealise their subjects, while
in those of others who, like Rubens, interpret nature more
literally, the apparent disproportion becomes grotesque; or, in
the coarser hands of Jordaens, even repulsive.</p>

<p>These painters were, after all, true interpreters of nature.
In infancy and early childhood the abdomen is much larger
comparatively than in the grown person. For this there is a
twofold cause; the larger size of the liver on the one hand,
and the smaller development of the hips on the other. In a
weakly child this appearance is exaggerated by its want of
muscular power, which allows the intestines to become much
distended with air. If the child is not merely weakly but also
ricketty, the contracted chest will leave less room than natural
for the lungs, while at the same time the ordinary development
of the hips being arrested by the rickets, the disproportion is
further increased both by that and by the flatulence due to the
imperfect digestion with which the condition is almost always
associated.</p>

<p>In no case need the mere size of the abdomen occasion
grave anxiety, so long as when the child lies upon its back the
abdomen is uniformly soft, nor so long as even if tense it is not
tender, and as it everywhere gives out a hollow sound like a
drum when tapped with the finger.</p>

<p>It is not for a moment meant that no notice is to be taken,
nor opinion asked, as to the cause of excessive size of the abdomen,
for its distension may be due to real disease; but it is yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>worth while to remember that its mere size is not of itself
evidence of disease, nor cause of grave anxiety.</p>

<p><b>Worms.</b>&mdash;There is no mistaking or overlooking the existence
of <i>worms</i> when they are really present. Their presence,
however, is often suspected without any sufficient reason.
Ravenous or uncertain appetite, indigestion, flatulence, undue
size of the abdomen, a dark circle round the eyes, itching of
the nose and of the entrance of the bowel, a coated tongue,
and offensive breath are no real proof of the presence of
worms, and do not justify the frequent repetition of violent
purgatives or of so-called worm medicines. The only real
proof of the presence of worms is their being seen in the
evacuations.</p>

<p>The worms commonly found in children are either the round-worm,
which resembles the earth-worm, the thread-worm, or
the tape-worm; the appearance of each of which is clearly
indicated by its name. None of them are spontaneously generated
in the body, but they are all introduced from without;
their eggs, or, as they are technically called, their ova, being
swallowed unperceived in some article of food, or drink. A
proof of this is afforded by the fact that an infant, so long as it
is nourished exclusively at the breast, never has worms.</p>

<p>The <i>round-worm</i> occasions the fewest symptoms, and is
rather an object of disgust than of grave importance, at least
in this country, where it seldom happens that more than two or
three are present. In other countries, as some parts of Italy,
for instance, where the drinking water is bad and stagnant, they
are sometimes found in great numbers, as thirty or forty, and
it is then not easy to determine whether the symptoms which
accompany them are produced by the worms, or by the unwholesome
character of the water in other respects.</p>

<p>They appear to live on the contents of the intestines, and
do not adhere to them, as the tape-worm does, and hence their
comparative harmlessness, and they have no power, as has sometimes
been mistakenly imagined, of perforating the bowels, and
of thus producing grave mischief.</p>

<p>The <i>thread-worm</i> is the commonest variety of these creatures,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>and has the peculiarity of inhabiting the lowest twelve inches
of the bowel, where it produces much irritation and causes
very distressing itching. It is often present in great numbers,
and is so rapidly reproduced, that in a week or two after it has
been apparently got rid of, it may again be found as numerous
as before. Certain articles of food seem to favour its development,
such as pastry, sugar, sweets, beer, fruit, and anything
which is apt to undergo fermentation, and thereby to impart
to the evacuations a specially acid character. These worms
are often accompanied with more or less marked symptoms of
indigestion, but otherwise the local irritation is usually the only
indication of their presence. They produce, indeed, such disturbance
of the nervous system as may attend indigestion in
any of its forms, but I have never but once known convulsions
occur apparently due to their presence in great numbers, and
ceasing on their expulsion; and this was in a child between
eighteen months and two years old.</p>

<p>The <i>tape-worm</i> is developed in the human body from a
minute germ or ovum; one form of which exists in the flesh of
the bullock, the other in that of the pig; and which seems to
require for its growth the favouring conditions of warmth and
moisture which are found in the intestines. It fixes itself to the
lining of the bowels by means of its mouth, which is furnished
with minute tentacles, and it thus derives its support from the
juices which it imbibes. The head is so small as not to be seen
distinctly without a magnifying glass; and immediately beyond
it the jointed body begins; at first, scarcely bigger than a thread
of worsted, but gradually enlarging, till at the distance of three
inches it is an eighth of an inch wide, and thence rapidly
widens till each joint is half an inch wide, and from a third
to half an inch apart. It does not exceed these dimensions,
even though it may grow to the length of four or six yards.
Portions of it, sometimes a yard or two in length, are thrown off
from its lower end occasionally, and this occurrence often gives
the first indication of its presence, the worm continuing to grow
as before, and fresh portions being detached from time to time.
It does not appear that the worm has the power of reproducing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>itself; hence its French name of <i>ver solitaire</i>, and the occasional
presence of two or three would seem to be due to the development
of two or three distinct ova within the intestine.</p>

<p>Deriving as it does its support from the system of the child,
and not as the other worms do from the contents of the bowel,
the tape-worm often produces graver inconveniences. It sometimes
causes uncomfortable colicky sensations, which may even
be very distressing, and the disorders of digestion which accompany
it are often very considerable; certainly more so than in
the case of the other varieties of worms; but I have seen no
instance of convulsions which could be attributed to them, notwithstanding
the generally received opinion to the contrary.</p>

<p>When the existence of worms is suspected, one or two doses
of a simple aperient, such as castor oil, repeated two days
successively, seldom fail to produce evidence of their presence;
which in the case of tape-worm is also furnished by the spontaneous
detachment of some of the joints. It must be remembered,
however, that until the head has been detached from its
connection with the bowel, nothing has been gained, and the
tape-worm will in a short time grow again. To obtain the detachment
of the head it is necessary that any worm medicine should
be given when the intestines are empty. I am, therefore,
always accustomed to give a dose of castor oil about two hours
after the child's mid-day meal; and to send the child to bed as
soon as the aperient begins to act, and to give it no more food
except a biscuit and a little milk and water during the rest of
the day. In the early morning, the special worm medicine is
given, and over and over again I have known the worm to be
brought away completely after many previous failures. When
the smallness of the joints shows that the greater part of the
worm has been thrown off, and that little more than the head
remains, it is necessary to have recourse to the unpleasant proceeding
of mixing the evacuations with water, and then straining
them through muslin, in order that the doctor may by
means of the microscope make out whether or no the head has
been really detached. This is no question of mere curiosity,
but a matter of the gravest moment, since nothing has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>really gained so long as the head of the worm remains adherent
to the bowel.</p>

<p>Precautions such as these are not needed in the case of the
other kinds of worms. Thread-worms, however, are best
attacked in their habitation; that is to say, in the lower bowel,
by means of lavements. It is, therefore, desirable before they
are administered that the bowels should be emptied by a dose
of castor oil.</p>

<p>The only other caution which remains for me to give refers
to the peculiar effect which salicine, a very valuable medicine,
especially in the case of thread-worms, has upon the urine. It
sometimes turns the urine of a greenish-yellow, often of a red
colour, as though it were mixed with blood. The appearance,
however, has no grave meaning, but is due simply to a chemical
action of the medicine on the colouring matter and salts of the
urine.</p>

<p>There still remain some local ailments of parts connected
with the process of digestion, concerning which a few words
must be said.</p>

<p><b>Ulcerated Mouth.</b>&mdash;First, with reference to the <i>sore-mouth</i>
of children. I have already noticed a form of inflammation
and ulceration of the gums sometimes met with during
teething, but the sore-mouth of which I am now about to speak
is often quite independent of that process; though it may sometimes
be found associated with it, and is indeed rarely met with
after five years of age. In almost all instances it is preceded
and attended with symptoms of indigestion, during the course
of which the mouth becomes inflamed, hot and red, and small
very painful shallow ulcers with sharp-cut edges, and a little
yellowish deposit on their surface, appear at the edge of the
tongue, on the inside of the mouth, and especially on the inside
of the lower lip, and the adjacent surface of the gum.
Successive crops of these little ulcerations not unfrequently
appear, so that for many weeks the child may be kept by them
in a state of extreme discomfort; swallowing, and even speaking
being the occasions of considerable suffering.</p>

<p>It is seldom that nursery remedies, and the so-called cooling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>medicines, though often of some service, suffice to get rid
of the ailment, which for the most part needs judicious medical
treatment, and local as well as constitutional measures. Now
and then this condition comes on in the course of measles, and
is then sometimes of serious importance.</p>

<p>In the other form, the disease is usually limited to the
gums, and affects especially those of the front of the lower jaw,
which become swollen, ulcerated at their edges, where a very
ill-smelling deposit takes place of a dirty white or greyish
colour, the surface beneath being spongy, swollen, raw, and
bleeding. The ulceration sometimes extends so as to lay bare
a large part of the sockets of the teeth; but though loosened
they seldom drop out. Coupled with this, the glands at the
angle of the jaw are swollen, and the child dribbles constantly
a large quantity of horribly offensive saliva. In the children of
the well-to-do classes the condition is seldom seen except in a
slight degree; but even when severe it is rarely accompanied
by any grave disorder of the general health. It seems to tend,
whether treated or left to itself, slowly to get well; but its
progress to a natural cure is extremely tedious, and the gums
are left by it for a long time spongy, bleeding easily, and only
very imperfectly covering the teeth.</p>

<p>Anxiety is sometimes excited by this condition; it being
supposed that the white deposit on the edge of the gum implies
some relation between it and diphtheria. This is not so, for
though this peculiar ulceration of the gums has now and then
been found associated with diphtheria, the nature of the two
diseases is essentially different. It is, however, always wise to
call in medical advice in order to settle this important question,
and the more so, since there is one remedy, the chlorate of
potass, which, in appropriate doses, acts upon the condition
almost as a charm.</p>

<p>I say nothing about a dreadful form of inflammation of
the mouth which ends in mortification, because it is of infinite
rarity except among the destitute poor, and even among them
it is very seldom seen except as a consequence of measles, or
of some kind of fever. It is only among the very poor that I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>have seen it, and even among them it has come under my
notice only ten times in the whole course of my life.</p>

<p>There is a very common but inaccurate opinion that sore-mouth
in childhood is often produced by the employment of
mercury. I never yet saw a sore mouth due to the administration
of mercury in any child before the first set of teeth were
entirely cut; and never but once out of 70,000 cases which
have come under my notice in hospital or dispensary practice,
have I seen in children of any age under twelve any affection
of the mouth from mercury sufficiently severe to cause me a
moment's anxiety.</p>

<p><b>Quinsey</b>, or inflammatory sore-throat, has in it nothing
specially peculiar to the child, but occurs at all ages with the
same symptoms. It is, however, comparatively rare under
twelve years of age, and is almost always less severe in childhood
than at or after puberty, while I scarcely remember to have
met with it under five years of age. This circumstance attaches
special importance to sore-throat in young children, since it
will usually be found to betoken the approach of scarlet fever,
or of diphtheria, rather than the existence of simple inflammation,
or quinsey.</p>

<p>While this fact affords a reason for most scrupulous attention
to every case of sore-throat in children, and this in proportion
to the tender age of the child, needless alarm is sometimes
caused by the appearance on the inflamed tonsils of numerous
white specks, which are at once supposed to be diphtheritic. I
have already pointed out the distinction between the two conditions
when speaking of diphtheria, but the matter is so
important that I will repeat what I then said. These spots are
not in the form of a uniform white patch or membrane, which,
on being removed, leaves the surface beneath red, raw, and often
slightly bleeding; but they are rather distinct circular spots,
firmly adherent to the tonsil, wiped off with difficulty, and evidently
exuding from the openings of little pits, blind pouches,
or glands, with which the surface of the tonsil is beset. I do
not advise any parent to rest satisfied with his or her judgment
on this matter the first time that they notice this appearance;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>but there are children with whom slight sore-throat is always
attended by this condition, and others in whom the tonsils are
habitually enlarged, and seldom free from these white spots
flecking their surface.</p>

<p><b>Enlarged Tonsils.</b>&mdash;I have said that quinsey or acute
inflammation of the tonsils is unusual in early childhood; but
a sort of chronic inflammation of those glands which leads to
their very considerable enlargement is far from uncommon; and
is sometimes the cause of very serious discomfort. It is seldom
traceable to any acute attack of sore-throat, but usually comes
on imperceptibly in children who are feeble or out of health, or
takes place slowly during the cutting of the first set of grinding
teeth; the irritation which that produces being in some cases
its only apparent exciting cause. Not seldom the enlargement
has become considerable before it attracts attention; one of the
first symptoms that indicate it being the loud snoring of the
child during sleep, who is compelled by the obstruction at the
back of the nostrils to breathe with its mouth open. The voice
at the same time becomes thick, and this and the snoring breathing
are both greatly aggravated when the child catches cold.</p>

<p>A greater degree of enlargement of the tonsils occasions
deafness from pressure on the passage leading to the internal
ear, and is also apt to give rise to a troublesome hacking cough
which sometimes excites apprehension lest the child's lungs
should be diseased. When still more considerable the enlarged
tonsils block up the passage through the nostrils, and air consequently
enters the lungs but very imperfectly. The nostrils thus
disused become extremely small, narrow, and compressed, the
upper jaw does not undergo its proper development, the teeth
are crowded and overlap each other, the palate remains narrow
and unusually high-arched, and the face assumes something of
a bird-like character. Besides this the child grows pigeon-breasted,
owing to the lungs not being filled sufficiently at each
inspiration to overcome the pressure of the external air on the
yielding sides of the chest.</p>

<p>When any considerable enlargement of the tonsils exists, each
cold that the child may catch aggravates it, and if diphtheria,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>scarlatina, or severe sore-throat should occur, the temporary
increase of the swelling may become the occasion of serious
danger. The question arises, what are the chances that a child
whose tonsils are enlarged will outgrow the condition, or when
is it necessary to have the enlarged tonsils removed?</p>

<p>It scarcely ever happens that any such enlargement of the
tonsils exists in children under six years of age as to call for
their removal. There is almost always ground for the hope
that after the irritation caused by cutting the first four permanent
grinding teeth has completely ceased, the tonsils may return by
degrees to their former size. A similar shrinking of the enlarged
tonsil sometimes takes place, especially in the boy, at the time
of approach to manhood, when the vocal organs undergo full
development. This can be counted on, however, only in cases
where the tonsils are not of extreme size, and have not undergone
frequent attacks of inflammation. Whenever the hearing
is habitually dull, and the voice always thick, when cough is
frequent, the nostrils narrow, the chest pigeon-breasted, and the
child feeble and ill-thriven, removal of the tonsils is absolutely
necessary. In cases where the question is doubtful, its decision
must turn on whether the tonsils have often been inflamed. So
long as their surface is smooth, and their substance soft and
elastic, delay is permissible. When their substance is hard, like
gristle, and their surface uneven and corrugated, they have
undergone such changes that absorption is impossible, and their
removal absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>I dwell thus particularly on the question of removal of the
tonsils, because there is among many persons an unreasoning
dread of the operation, which is entirely devoid of danger,
requiring only a few seconds for its performance, and which
may even be done under chloroform. The painting tincture
of iodine behind the angle of the jaw, or the touching the
tonsils with caustic, iodine, alum, tannin, or sweet spirits of
nitre are utterly futile proceedings. They diminish the unhealthy
and often offensive secretion from the glands which beset the
tonsils, and restore the surface to a more healthy condition, but
they are absolutely without influence in lessening their size.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>Now and then all the symptoms of enlarged tonsils are
present, but yet most careful examination fails to discover any
increase of their size. When this is the case the symptoms are
due to a thickening of the membrane at the back part of the
nostrils, often attended with spongy outgrowths from their
surface, which obstruct just as completely as enlarged tonsils
would do the free entrance of air. It will, in any case where
this condition is suspected, be absolutely necessary to seek
the advice of some of those gentlemen who make a specialty
of diseases of the throat, and who will have the necessary
technical dexterity to discover the condition, and to treat it
skilfully.</p>

<p><b>Abscess at back of the Throat.</b>&mdash;I should pass unnoticed,
on account of its rarity, the occasional formation of
an abscess at the back of the throat, behind the gullet, interfering
both with breathing and with swallowing, but that the
description of it in my Lectures once enabled a lady in the
wilds of Russia to detect it, to point out the nature of the case
to her puzzled doctor, to urge him to open the abscess, and
thus to save her child's life.</p>

<p>This abscess may form at any age, sometimes after fever,
sometimes without any obvious cause. It shows itself by
difficulty in swallowing and breathing, unattended by cough,
but accompanied by a sound similar to that of croup, but not
so harsh or ringing. The neck is stiff, the head thrown back,
and often there is a distinct swelling on one or other side of
the neck. The finger introduced into the mouth, and carried
over the tongue to the back of the throat, feels there a swelling
which projects over the top of the windpipe, and causes the
difficulty both in swallowing and breathing. This swelling is
the abscess; a prick with the surgeon's lancet lets out the
matter, and saves the child.</p>

<p><b>Diseases of the Kidneys.</b>&mdash;The <i>kidneys</i> perform very
important duties in carrying off from the system a large amount
of useless material, and thus supplement in many respects the
action of the skin, and the purifying influence which is exercised
by the air on the blood, as it passes through the lungs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>It is evident, therefore, that their disorder in any way must
be a matter of serious moment, though at the same time the
knowledge of the skilled doctor is needed to determine the
nature and degree of the ailment from which they are suffering,
since that requires an examination of the urine, both chemically
and by means of the microscope. My remarks on these
diseases must consequently be few and fragmentary.</p>

<p>In the grown person, what is known as <i>Bright's disease</i> is
of frequent occurrence, assumes different forms, and depends
on various causes. In the child it is comparatively rare, and is
scarcely ever met with except as a consequence of a chill, or as
a result of scarlatina. In these conditions the kidneys become
overfilled with blood or congested, and the congestion may pass
into inflammation, by which their structure may be irreparably
damaged. Dropsy is the great outward sign of the affection&mdash;either
slight swelling of the face, eyelids, and ankles, or very
great swelling of all the limbs, and even the abundant pouring
out of fluid into the belly. The degree of dropsy is, however,
by no means an absolute measure of the amount of kidney
mischief. It therefore behoves every parent to follow out all
directions most scrupulously even in cases of very slight dropsy,
in order to guard against the risk of permanent injury to the
kidneys being left behind; and especially to remember the
liability to the occurrence of dropsy and disease of the kidneys
after scarlatina. Any check to the action of the skin while it
is peeling or desquamating, as it is termed, is especially liable
to be followed by these accidents. To avoid all risks as far
as possible, I have been accustomed for many years to insist
on a child remaining in bed for one-and-twenty days after the
first appearance of the rash in even the mildest case of scarlatina,
and I am absolutely sure that it is the height of imprudence
ever to neglect this precaution.</p>

<p>It will suffice to mention the fact that <i>diabetes</i>, though very
rare, may yet occur in childhood, and that as a rule it is more
dangerous in childhood than in the grown person. Whenever
a child loses flesh without obvious cause, suffers much from
thirst, and at the same time passes urine in greater abundance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>than in health, the possibility that it may suffer from diabetes
must be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Of far greater frequency than any other affection of the
kidney is that in which the child passes <i>gravel</i> with the urine,
either in the form of a reddish-white sediment, which collects
at the bottom of the vessel as the urine cools, or of minute
glistening red particles, which resemble grains of cayenne
pepper.</p>

<p>These deposits, when abundant in the male child, have a
tendency to collect in the bladder, and there to form a stone.
This painful disease, too, is so much more frequent in childhood
than at a later age, that more than a third&mdash;indeed, nearly
half&mdash;of all the operations for stone performed in English
hospitals are done on boys under ten years old.</p>

<p>Even when this grave consequence does not follow the
presence of gravel in the kidneys, and its passage into the
bladder, it is often accompanied with much suffering. The
pain is like that of stomach-ache or colic, the child crying
and drawing up its legs on every attempt to pass water, which
sometimes is voided only in a few drops at a time, and now
and then is completely suppressed for some hours. The very
acute form of the ailment seldom occurs, except in infants who
inherit from their parents a disposition to gouty or rheumatic
affections. In them, however, a trifling cold, slight disorder of
the digestion, a state of constipation, or the feverishness and
general irritation which sometimes attend on teething, not infrequently
produce these deposits and give rise to all these painful
symptoms, the deposit disappearing and the pain ceasing so
soon as the brief constitutional disturbance subsides.</p>

<p>The very acute attacks seldom occur after the first two
years of life, but similar symptoms, though less severe, are by
no means unusual in older children, and continue to recur
from very trifling causes, especially from errors in diet and disorders
of digestion.</p>

<p>In spite of the suffering which for the time attends it, there
is no cause for anxiety with reference to the issue of each
attack. The warm bath, a castor oil aperient, and soothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>medicine soon relieve the pain, and the children return to their
former state of health. It is the frequent return of the attack,
even in a comparatively mild form, the persistent disposition
to the formation of gravel, the remote risk in the case of male
children of stone in the bladder, and the habitually imperfect
performance of the digestive functions which call for special
care. The avoidance of sugar, sweets, and whatever tends to
impart acidity to the urine, the maintaining the due action of
the skin by wearing flannel, and the judicious use of alkaline
remedies, sometimes combined with iron, are the measures on
which the doctor is sure to insist.</p>

<p>The difficulty usually encountered in the treatment of these
cases arises from the reluctance of the parents to continue for
months and years the observance of the necessary rules. It
seems so hard to deny their little one the small gratifications in
which other children may indulge with impunity; and they fail
to realise the heavy penalty, in the shape of gout, rheumatism,
gravel, and stone, which in after-life their darling may have to
pay for their over-indulgence in his early years.</p>

<p>I will just mention that symptoms similar to those above
described, less severe, though more abiding, yet unattended
by gravel in the urine, are sometimes produced in little boys
by an unnatural narrowness of the end of the passage for the
urine. It is well to bear in mind this possible cause of the
child's sufferings, and to consult a doctor with reference to it,
since he will be able to relieve it by a trivial operation.</p>

<p><b>Incontinence of Urine.</b>&mdash;The irritation which this mechanical
inconvenience produces sometimes has to do with
that troublesome infirmity of some children, who wet the bed
at night. This may also be induced by a very acid, and consequently
irritating, state of urine, either with or without the
appearance in it of gravel. Often, however, it is a result of
want of care on the part of the nurse, who neglects to cultivate
regular habits in a child; and does not pay attention to the
quantity of liquid taken at its last meal. Something, too, is
due to the fact that the sleep of a child is deeper than that of
the grown person, so that the sensation of want, which would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>arouse the latter to full consciousness, does not have the same
effect on the former. It sometimes happens undoubtedly from
mere indolence; and this may always be suspected when a
child, otherwise healthy, wets itself not at night only, but also
in the daytime. Lastly, it does sometimes occur from muscular
feebleness in weakly children, the bladder being unable to bear
more than a limited degree of distension.</p>

<p>The accident usually happens either soon after going to
bed, when the warmth stimulates the action of the bladder, or
towards morning, when the bladder has become full. The
posture on the back favours its occurrence very much, and it
is therefore of importance that the child should lie on its side
when in bed. The good effect of a blister on the lower part
of the back as a means of cure was largely due to its forcing
the child to lie on its side. This object can be attained, however,
in a much kindlier way, by tying half a dozen cotton reels
together, and fastening them at the child's back. The habit
may also often be broken through by arousing the child in the
night, and compelling it to empty its bladder, the hour being
first ascertained at which the accident usually happens. For
this, however, to be of any real use, the child must be awakened
thoroughly; since otherwise it will mechanically, and quite
unconsciously, empty its bladder while still asleep. The habit
in this case is not in the least overcome; only for the time the
bed escapes the wetting. The utensil must therefore be placed
on different nights at different parts of the room, so that the
child, in order to find it, must have been roused to thorough
consciousness.</p>

<p>Lastly, I will add that the cases in which the accident is
the result of mere indolence are very rare, and though in such
cases strictness may be necessary, yet actual punishment is out
of place. As a rule, reward answers much better. A penny,
or a threepenny-piece every night that the accident does not
happen, and a forfeit of a halfpenny or two pence for every
night of misfortune, is a very efficacious help to a cure.</p>

<p>When all these domestic means, persevered in for months,
fail to produce any result, medical aid must be called in.</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES.</h3>


<p>There remains for consideration a large class of what may
be termed <i>constitutional diseases</i>, in which the local ailment is
the outcome of a previous disorder of the whole system. These
diseases are either acute or chronic. The acute constitutional
diseases belong to the class of fevers. These are marked by
certain local characteristics, as the swelling of the joints in
acute rheumatism, the sore-throat in scarlatina, or the eruption
on the skin in smallpox, and their course is more or less strictly
limited by distinct periods of increase, acme, and decline. No
such rule obtains in the case of consumption, scrofula, and
rickets, which are instances of chronic constitutional diseases.
In them too the local manifestations of the general disease
vary also: the lungs being affected in one case of consumption,
the bowels in another; while scrofula may show itself by
affection of the glands in one case, by the formation of abscesses
in a second, or by disease of the bones in a third.</p>

<p><b>Chronic Constitutional Diseases.</b>&mdash;It may perhaps be
convenient to study first the chronic constitutional diseases;
and afterwards to make a few, and they will be but few, remarks
on fevers.</p>

<p><b>Consumption</b> and Scrofula, though similar, are not the
same disease. Both, however, depend on some defect in the
blood, as the result of which certain materials, incapable of
being converted into the natural constituents of the body, are
deposited in the substance of different external parts or internal
organs. If deposited in small quantities, these materials may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>be absorbed, as it is termed, that is to say, got rid of, by natural
processes, which even now we understand but imperfectly.</p>

<p>If deposited more abundantly, they press upon and gradually
spoil the healthy parts in which they are seated, and
thereby interfere with the proper performance of their duties.
Thus, the deposit of consumption encroaches on the proper
substance of the lungs, and so lessens the area in which the
blood is exposed to the air and purified: the deposit of scrofula
around and in a joint interferes with its powers of movement.
Nor is this all; but wherever any deposit has once taken place,
it tends especially to increase in that very spot, guided as it
were by a certain affinity; and the substance of the previously
healthy part is removed as fresh deposit comes to occupy its
place. Further, the matter deposited has no power of being
changed into healthy substance of lung, or of bone, or of any
other part.</p>

<p>A fractured limb may be completely mended; a fluid is
poured out around and between the edges of the broken bone;
by degrees this hardens, it undergoes changes which convert it
into solid bone, and the limb is once more as serviceable as
before, though some indications of the fracture may still be
perceptible in the texture of the bone itself. Or, a person
receives a severe blow on his arm or leg; in course of time the
blood which had flowed from the ruptured vessels, and had
formed a big bruise, is absorbed, and all is as before the injury
was inflicted. If more serious damage has been done, the
fibres of some muscles may have been torn, even though the
skin remains unbroken. Inflammation is set up, the injured
parts die, and are melted down into the matter of an abscess.
The abscess discharges itself, its walls contract, the opposite
surfaces come into contact, and are welded together again, so
that there is no loss of substance, nor anything save a scar on
the surface to indicate what has happened.</p>

<p>In the case of the deposits of consumption or scrofula
these changes cannot take place. In technical language the
matter is said to be incapable of organisation; that is to say,
it cannot be transformed by nature's alchemy into anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>good or useful. It is rubbish to be got rid of; and the patient's
recovery depends on the possibility of getting rid of it.
If there is much of it, so as to be removed from the vivifying
influence which adjacent living structures still maintain about
it, the deposit softens at its centre. This softening gradually
extends to the circumference; the mass irritates more and
more the parts around it, and where the irritation is greatest
the structures yield, and are removed to make a way for its
escape, and the patient spits up the contents of the abscess.</p>

<p>But the abscess of the lungs is not like an abscess which
follows an injury. It has not formed in the midst of previously
healthy parts which are capable of reproducing the original
structure; its walls are themselves involved in the disease, and,
in accordance with the rule I have already mentioned, 'much
will have more,' and the patient goes on spitting up the perpetually
renewed contents of the abscess for months or years;
until by its gradually increasing size, and the more and more
abundant discharge of matter, and further and further destruction
of lung-substance, death takes place.</p>

<p>This fatal issue, however, is not invariable. In favourable
circumstances, and especially in childhood, the radical constitutional
defect may be amended, and with a healthier condition
of the blood the unhealthy deposit may cease to take place.
The lung-substance, however, with all its curious structure of
air-cells and their network of minute vessels where, as in
nature's laboratory, the blood receives its due supply of oxygen,
is not reproduced. The lung shrinks, the sides of the abscess
come together, and by slow degrees a dense material cuts it off
from the adjacent healthy structure, but the most complete recovery
leaves the patient with his breathing power lessened,
and with his vigour consequently more or less impaired.</p>

<p>When the deposit is less considerable, a different change
takes place. The material dries by degrees, and is at last converted
by a purely chemical change into a hard chalky substance,
which in the course of time becomes of more than stony
hardness.</p>

<p>Last of all; when the deposit is smallest in quantity, it may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>be completely got rid of; and a lung in which consumptive
disease once existed, may eventually regain perfect soundness.</p>

<p>I have dwelt on these processes as they take place in the
lungs; but, allowing for differences of locality, they resemble
such as take place elsewhere.</p>

<p>Three important conclusions follow from what has been said.</p>

<p>First. It is only in quite the early stage of consumptive
disease that absolutely perfect recovery can be hoped for.
There is a euphemism, more amiable than honest, which
doctors not seldom make use of, saying that a child's lungs are
not diseased, but only tender. They mean by this, that on
listening to the chest, they detect such changes in the sounds
of breathing as their experience tells them are usually produced
in the early stage of consumptive disease of the lungs. If the
opinion is confirmed by a second competent medical man,
<i>then, and not later</i>, is the time for precautions, for removing the
child from school, and for selecting, as far as may be, a suitable
winter climate. When the signs of disease are well marked, a
reprieve, perhaps a long one, is all that can be confidently
reckoned on.</p>

<p>Second. When softening of the consumptive deposit has
taken place, of which certain sounds attending breathing are all
but conclusive, recovery, even the most complete, always implies
loss of a certain amount of lung-substance, and consequently
loss of a certain amount of breathing power.</p>

<p>Third, and this is most important, as well as most cheering;
consumption, which is at no age the absolutely hopeless disease
that it was once supposed to be, admits of far more cheerful
anticipations in children than in grown persons, or, for that
matter, than in the youth or maiden.</p>

<p>The principal <i>causes</i> of consumptive disease are, hereditary
predisposition, and improper feeding in infancy. There are
besides two diseases incidental to childhood, and one of them
almost peculiar to it, namely typhoid fever and measles, which
are more apt than any others to develop a tendency to consumption.
During convalescence from either of them, therefore,
special care is needed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>In the grown person, consumption almost always attacks
the lungs, and this often to the exclusion of other organs. In
the child, however, this is not so, and though the lungs are
indeed oftener affected than other parts, yet in nearly half of
the cases some one or other of the digestive organs is likewise
involved, and in about one in seven instances the lungs are free
and the digestive organs alone are attacked.</p>

<p>Fever, cough, and wasting are the three sets of symptoms
which in some degree or other are always present in consumptive
disease of the lungs. The fever in the early stages of consumption
is not in general severe; but so long as the evening
temperature of a child never exceeds 99&deg;, there is no cause for
anxiety. On the other hand, if the evening temperature for a
week or ten days together always amounts to 100&deg;, there is
grave presumption that consumptive disease is present. In
advanced consumption the evening temperature is constantly
103&deg; to 105&deg;, while in the morning it may fall to 101&deg; or 100&deg;.</p>

<p>Cough is but rarely absent even in cases where the lungs
are but slightly involved, for the irritation of the digestive
organs often excites a sympathetic cough, and in these circumstances
observation of the evening temperature will often furnish
a clue to the right interpretation of the symptoms.</p>

<p>There is a form of cough which is oftenest observed in
children between the ages of two and five years, which comes
in fits closely resembling those of hooping-cough, and each
fit ends in a sort of imperfect 'hoop.' This may depend on a
particular form of consumption in which the <i>glands connected
with the lungs</i> (the bronchial glands as they are called) <i>are
diseased</i>, and not the lung-substance itself. The enlarged
glands press on some of the nerves connected with the upper
part of the windpipe, and thus occasion the spasmodic cough.
Always suspect this when a cough persists for weeks together,
not getting rapidly worse as hooping-cough would do, but at
the same time not growing better, as would be the case with
mild hooping-cough. The doctor on listening to the chest
will solve your doubts; the thermometer will help you to
decide whether his visit is necessary. I may add that this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>form of consumptive disease is less serious than that in which
the lung-substance is involved.</p>

<p>Consumption sometimes follows bronchitis, especially when
a child has been subject to frequent attacks of it. A very slow
and imperfect recovery from an attack of bronchitis which had
not been specially severe is always a reason for solicitude.</p>

<p>Now and then infants are born with consumptive disease.
In that case the lungs are always affected; and the symptoms
of fever, cough, and wasting usually show themselves within the
first three or four months, and the infants almost invariably
die within the year. Now and then, however, an infant thus
affected may continue apparently in good health for a few
months, and then be suddenly attacked by symptoms of acute
inflammation or of severe bronchitis which prove rapidly fatal;
and it may be found after death that the acute attack destroyed
life because the lungs were already the seat of extensive consumptive
disease.</p>

<p>No infant in whose mother's family a predisposition to consumption
exists ought to be nursed by its mother, but by a
healthy wet nurse; or, if that is impossible, it should be brought
up on a milk diet, with but a small admixture of farinaceous
food.</p>

<p>There is a form of very rapid, or so-called galloping consumption,
which is seldom observed before the age of seven
years; generally two or three years later. Its symptoms so
closely resemble those of typhoid fever, that it may readily be
mistaken for it. I refer to it in order to say that the doctor
who mistakes the one for the other can scarcely be regarded
as blameworthy; and the mistake is of the less importance
since the treatment applicable to the one case would do no
harm in the other.</p>

<p>I have already noticed the connection between water on
the brain and consumption. It is indeed nothing else than
inflammation excited by the presence of the deposit of consumptive
matter in the brain or its membranes.</p>

<p>Little has been said hitherto about the wasting which was
referred to as one of the characteristics of consumption. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>the disease is limited, or nearly so, to the lungs, the wasting is
not considerable until the mischief in the chest is far advanced.
It must be remembered, however, in order to judge of this, that
while in the full-grown man the best sign of health is the persistence
for years together of the same weight, the case of the
child is different. The child ought to grow in height, and increase
in weight, and during these changes the plump infant
grows thinner, not by real wasting but by conversion of its fat
into bone and muscle. The child is thinner, but is taller and
weighs heavier. The only real test therefore of the condition
of the child is afforded by its increase in height and in weight.
One need not be solicitous about the child who increases in
height, and maintains his previous weight, nor about him who
while he does not grow yet becomes heavier; but the child
who neither gains in weight, nor in height, or who loses weight
out of proportion to his increased height, is in a condition that
warrants anxiety. I have long been accustomed, in the case of
children whose parents were resident in India, to instruct those
who have charge of them to send every three months a statement
of the height and weight of the children, as the best
evidence of their state of health.</p>

<p><b>Consumptive Disease of the Bowels.</b>&mdash;Consumptive
disease sometimes invades the whole system from the very
first, while in other instances it attacks from the outset the
organs of digestion, and continues throughout to affect them
chiefly, and loss of flesh is then one of its earliest symptoms.
In instances where there is a strong family predisposition to the
disease, consumption of the bowels or mesenteric disease, or
disease of the glands of the bowels, all three popular names for
the affection, sometimes shows itself at the time of weaning. In
the majority of cases, however, it comes on later, after the completion
of teething, and between the age of three and ten years.
Indigestion such as I have already spoken of sometimes precedes
it, with the irregular condition of bowels, and the patchy
state of the tongue. But this is by no means constant, scarcely
I think general; and not infrequently momentary, causeless,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>colicky pains precede for a short time any other symptom. In
a few weeks after their occurrence, sometimes indeed independently
of them, the appetite fails, or becomes capricious; the
bowels begin to act irregularly, being alternately constipated
and relaxed; and the motions are unnatural in character, being,
for the most part, dark, loose, and slimy. Sometimes indeed,
they are solid, and then often white, as if from complete inactivity
of the liver, and sometimes half-liquid, frothy, and like
yeast. One peculiarity which they always present, be their
other characters what they may, is their extreme abundance,
quite out of proportion to the quantity of food taken, and due
to their admixture with the unhealthy secretions from the bowels.
The child next becomes restless and feverish at night, its
thirst is considerable, and the colicky pains become both more
severe and more frequent. Sometimes the stomach grows very
irritable, and the food taken is occasionally vomited, while the
tongue, in the early stages of the affection, continues for the
most part clean and moist, and except that it is often unnaturally
red deviates but little from its appearance in health. Next
comes a change in the condition of the belly, the date of which
varies considerably. It becomes larger than natural, owing to
the filling of the bowels with wind, but at the same time it is
tense and tender on pressure&mdash;two points of great importance
to be noticed, and the glands in the groin, which in a healthy
child cannot be felt, become enlarged, and are felt and perhaps
even seen like tiny beans under the skin.</p>

<p>As in other forms of consumptive disease, so here the
progress from bad to worse seldom goes on uninterruptedly.
Pauses take place in its course, though each time they become
shorter; and signs of amendment now and then appear, but
they too promise less and less with each return. The child
wastes rapidly; is always more or less feverish; the abdomen
is constantly tender, but does not in general go on increasing
in size; the pains become more frequent and more severe,
and the bowels are almost always habitually relaxed. Life is
sometimes cut short by the lungs becoming affected, but when
this is not the case the patient may linger on for weeks, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>months, or even for two or three years, until, worn to a skeleton,
death at last takes place from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Much apprehension is often needlessly excited in the minds
of parents, with reference to any child whose digestion is imperfect,
who loses flesh, and has a large abdomen; and the words
mesenteric disease, sometimes uttered thoughtlessly by the doctors,
seem to them to seal their little one's doom. Now, first of all,
it must be remembered that mesenteric disease, due to consumption,
plays but a very small part in the production of the symptoms
just described, but that the covering and the lining of the
bowels are chiefly involved. Next, enlargement of the mesenteric
glands and disorder of their functions take place from many
causes other than consumption. They are always more or
less enlarged in typhoid fever; they become enlarged when
irritated by unwholesome food in infancy, or they may swell
in the course of chronic indigestion. In all these cases too, the
glands in the groin may be enlarged by sympathy, and this
without the existence of any actual abiding disease. A big
abdomen is, of itself, no evidence of it, nor even when associated
with indigestion and frequent stomach-ache; but when to these
you add abiding tenderness, and an evening temperature always
at least one degree above that in the morning, there is every
reason to fear that consumptive disease has attacked the organs
of digestion.</p>

<p>Even then, however, there is no ground for despair; for,
while consumptive disease in any form is less seldom recovered
from in childhood than in after-life, such recovery oftener takes
place in cases of affection of the digestive organs than when
the disease is seated elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Scrofula.</b>&mdash;With this word of comfort I leave the subject
of consumption, and pass to that of the allied disease <i>scrofula</i>.
Briefly stated, two of the great differences between it and
consumption are that scrofula is almost entirely limited to
childhood and youth, while consumption may occur at any
age; and next, that while scrofula attacks the bones and the
glands, the skin and the membranes adjacent to it, consumption
has its seat in the lungs, the brain, and the internal organs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>Scrofulous diseases of the bones come so exclusively under
the observation of the surgeon, that I do not feel myself competent
to say anything about them. I would however warn
all parents to be very much alive to the importance of noticing
the early symptoms of any such diseases, as shown by slight
lameness, complaint of pain in the back, or difficulty in moving
the hand or arm, or in turning the head or bending the neck.
They may be but temporary accidents, due to cold, or to slight
muscular rheumatism, or to some sprain not noticed at the
time; but they may also be signs of the commencement of
scrofulous disease of some bone; and in no disease whatever
is early judicious treatment of greater value, or the result of
neglect less remediable.</p>

<p>Besides these graver ailments which seldom appear until
after the time of infancy has passed, there are others of a less
serious nature which often show themselves within the first
year of life. One of these consists in the formation beneath the
skin of numerous small lumps of a rounded form, and of the
size of a kidney-bean, slightly movable, and not tender. By
degrees such lumps become adherent to the skin, the surface
of which above them grows red, they project slightly above it,
and at last open by a small circular aperture, discharge a little
matter, and then subside. They collapse and disappear; a
slight depression and a degree of lividity of the skin mark for a
considerable time the situation they had occupied. I refer to
them, because while they are a sign of a scrofulous constitution,
which may require special care in diet and preparations
of iron and cod-liver oil, they are best left absolutely alone&mdash;neither
poulticed nor lanced. The same principle of non-intervention
applies equally to the swellings which sometimes
form on two or three of the fingers in infancy, not involving
the joints but producing great thickening and a hard swelling
around the bone. These swellings disappear by degrees as the
constitutional vigour improves, and this is especially promoted
by a long stay at the seaside; but they tend, if the health fails,
to affect the bones themselves, and thus to occasion deformities
of the hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Glandular swelling, discharges from the ear, offensive
secretion from the nose, and in female children, even of very
tender age, a discharge of whites, are all common signs of a
scrofulous constitution, and all tedious and troublesome.
They all, however, are very much under the influence of
judicious medical treatment. It must at the same time be
borne in mind that none of these ailments admit of what may
be called active treatment. There are no royal means of
dispersing scrofulous glands, or of curing discharges from the
ear, or of doing away with the offensive smell which in some
cases proceeds from the nostrils. Fresh air, suitable diet,
preparations of iron, residence at the seaside, and sea-bathing,
measures directed to improve the general health, are of chief
value, and without them local treatment is of small avail.</p>

<p>A few words, however, may with propriety be added with
reference to the local treatment of the minor ailments to which
I have just referred.</p>

<p>No local application is of use in the <i>scrofulous swellings
of the fingers</i>. Tincture of iodine, indeed, may be painted over
them when quite small, while at the same time the joints are
kept quiet by a small gutta-percha splint. When they become
considerable, iodine is useless; and even if matter forms in the
swelling it is much better to let it make its way out by a small
opening spontaneously than to make a puncture with a lancet,
since the edges of the wound would not heal, and the risk of
the disease affecting the bone would be increased.</p>

<p>The <i>glandular swellings</i> of the neck or about the lower jaw
are likewise best let alone, or merely covered with a layer of
cotton wool, stitched inside a piece of oiled silk to maintain a
uniform temperature. If they become suddenly painful and
more swollen, a cooling lotion of Goulard water and spirits of
wine, constantly applied, will reduce the swelling and lessen the
discomfort. When stationary, a mild iodine ointment may be
smeared over the gland at bedtime, and covered with oiled
silk. Applications of iodine, however, need careful watching,
for sometimes they over-irritate the gland, and cause an
abscess. If the gland were out of sight there would be no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>objection to this, which would probably be a rapid mode of
getting rid of the swelling; but the scar left behind, if the
abscess burst or were opened, is an objection when the swelling
is situated in the neck or at the jaw.</p>

<p>If the skin over the top of the swelling becomes red, and
its substance begins to feel soft, then, but not till then, it is
desirable to apply a warm poultice constantly. At the same
time the progress must be daily watched by the doctor, in
order that he may seize the proper moment to make a small
puncture and let out the matter. The small cut leaves a less
puckered scar than the natural opening. The subsequent
management of the case must be superintended by the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Offensive discharge from the nostrils</i> does not depend, in by
far the majority of cases, on disease of the bones, but on an
unhealthy condition of their lining membrane. It is exceedingly
obstinate and difficult of cure, is four times more frequent
in girls than in boys, and unfortunately often lasts into
womanhood, and continues even when the general health is
perfect.</p>

<p>Much may be done to abate the annoyance by diligent
sniffing up the nostrils some weak disinfectant; or by regularly
irrigating the nostrils by means of a simple apparatus, to be
obtained from any instrument-maker. In spite of this, however,
it is often necessary to introduce a little plug of cotton
wool dipped in the fluid some distance up the nostrils, with a
thread attached by which it can be withdrawn, and a fresh one
substituted twice a day.</p>

<p>The discharge of <i>whites</i> is sometimes very troublesome, and
apt to return from the commencement of teething up even to
womanhood. It is a mere sign of debility, usually also connected
with a scrofulous habit, but has no further or graver
meaning. Locally, constant cold ablution by means of a
sponge held above the child, not touching it, is the great
remedy, and this may have to be repeated every hour or two if
the case is severe. Astringent lotions of different kinds may
be used in the same manner; while care must be taken that
the child's drawers are large and loose, so as not to irritate her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>when sitting. General treatment, however, sea air and sea
bathing are especially in these cases the great remedy.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that all these ailments have a
special tendency to recur; and that when people say 'Dr. A.
or Dr. B. did the child good for the time, but this or that
symptom returned as soon as the treatment was discontinued,'
as though this were the doctor's fault, they are unjust; for the
tendency to return of every form of scrofulous disease is one
of the great characteristics of the malady. Patience and
perseverance on the parents' part, even for months and years,
are often as much needed as skill on the part of the doctor.</p>

<p>One more remark may not be out of place. Some persons
have an impression that there is something specially shameful
in scrofulous disease, and while they will readily admit the
existence of a consumptive tendency in their family, they
almost resent the suggestion that their child's ailment is
scrofulous. For this prejudice there is absolutely no foundation.
There is no more reason for connecting scrofula in a child with
any antecedent wrong-doing on the part of its progenitors, than
there is for attaching that idea to the red hair or black eyes
which a child may have in common with the rest of its family.</p>

<p><b>Rickets.</b>&mdash;We sometimes see, especially in the poorer
quarters of a great city, persons dwarfed in stature, with large
hands, bowed legs, bent arms, swollen wrists and ankles,
walking with an awkward gait, though usually holding themselves
remarkably upright, with the face of a grown person on
the body of a child, and we know that they suffered from
<i>rickets</i> when young.</p>

<p>Rickets is essentially a disease of childhood, and of early
childhood, in which proper bone-formation does not take
place, the soft material, or gristle, which should turn to bone,
remaining long in the soft state. When, therefore, the child
begins to walk, or to use its limbs, they bend under the weight
of the body, or under their own weight, and with every slight
movement which its feeble muscular power enables it to make.
It does more, however, than interfere with the hardening of
the limbs: it arrests growth to a great degree, interferes with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>development, retards teething, postpones the closure of the
open part of the head, or fontanelle, weakens constitutional
vigour, and impairs muscular power. To this feeble muscular
power it is due that the child cannot make the effort to fill its
lungs completely, and hence the pressure of the external air
forces the soft ribs inwards, and gives to the chest the
peculiar form of pigeon-breast. In the course of time the
delayed bone-formation takes place, and the bones themselves
become as hard as ivory, but the limbs do not straighten, and
the deformity produced in infancy is but confirmed in after-life.</p>

<p>The greater degrees of rickets are scarcely ever seen among
the children of the wealthier classes, but over-crowded and
ill-ventilated nurseries, cots from which the air is well-nigh
shut out by closed sides and overhanging curtains; injudicious
feeding, with undue preponderance of farinaceous food,
often produce its slighter forms. I never yet saw rickets in a
child while brought up exclusively at its mother's breast.</p>

<p>The slighter forms of rickets show themselves in a tardy
closure of the infant's head, which sweats profusely when the
child is laid down to sleep; in big wrists, which contrast with
the attenuated arms; in a general limpness of the whole body,
and a bowing of the back under the weight of the head, which
bends as a green stick would bend if a weight were placed
upon it. They are further marked by backwardness in teething,
and by the irregular order in which the teeth appear, and,
further, by the peculiar narrowness of the chest, and by what
has been termed the beading of the ends of the ribs: little
round prominences due to a heaping up of gristle just where
the ribs join on to the breastbone, marking the spots at which
the tardy bone-making has come to a standstill.</p>

<p>Children who bear these stamps of rickets are far more
apt than others to suffer from spasmodic croup, and in them it
is also specially likely to be severe and to be accompanied by
convulsions. They will also be more liable than others to
attacks of bronchitis, they will suffer more during teething,
they will be often constipated, and will be troubled by various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>forms of indigestion. Now and then, too, they will have causeless
attacks of feverishness lasting for a few days, or for two or
three weeks, attended with general tenderness of the surface,
and a disposition to perspiration, which brings no relief but
serves only to weaken.</p>

<p>It is true that these symptoms do not often become immediately
dangerous to life, though spasmodic croup and bronchitis
both have their perils; but they interfere with health,
and growth, and good looks, and cheerfulness, and quick
intelligence.</p>

<p>If mothers would but ask themselves the real signification
of these symptoms, and change the conditions which surround
the child, and alter their mode of feeding it, they would many
and many a time be spared the heart-ache of seeing their little
ones grow up weakly, ugly, ill-thriven.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is so much easier to give cod-liver oil and
iron than to turn the best spare room into a night nursery, and
to uglify the cot by taking away the curtains which made it so
pretty, and to give up some of the pleasures of society in order
to superintend the preparation of the baby's food; that the
doctor is called in to correct by drugs the evil which drugs
cannot reach. Iron and cod-liver oil are very useful in the
second place; fresh air, good ventilation, and a wise diet must
always occupy the first.</p>

<p><b>Acute Constitutional Diseases.</b>&mdash;It still remains for
us to glance rapidly at the characters of the <i>acute constitutional
diseases</i>, all of which belong, as has already been stated, to the
class of fevers. Of them all but two are contagious&mdash;that is
to say, are capable of being communicated directly from person
to person. They are likewise infectious, or, in other words,
articles of bedding or clothes which have been worn by the
sick, retain a something&mdash;an exhalation from the breath, an
emanation from the skin, or a secretion from the bowels&mdash;which
may reproduce the same disease in a person previously healthy.</p>

<p>To this contagious and infectious property there are two
exceptions; the one is furnished by acute rheumatism, or
rheumatic fever, the other by intermittent fever, or ague.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><b>Rheumatic Fever.</b>&mdash;The main features of <i>rheumatic
fever</i> are the same at all ages. Fever, pain in the limbs,
swelling of the joints, sweats unattended by that relief which
usually accompanies abundant action of the skin in fevers, are
its characteristics. In the child all these symptoms are usually
less even than in the adult. The swelling of the joints in
particular is less considerable, and both the pain and the
swelling are apt to wander from one to another joint, or to a
different limb, instead of remaining fixed as they do in the
grown person for several days in the same joint, even though
fresh joints may be implicated in the course of the disease.</p>

<p>These circumstances tend to make people look on rheumatic
fever in the child too often as a comparatively trivial
ailment; and this not only because the suffering which attends
the disease is slighter, but because its duration is also shorter.
But there is one fact which forbids this low estimate of its importance,
and that is the great tendency to affection of the
heart even in cases of comparatively mild rheumatism in the
child; while in the grown person there is a direct relation
between the general severity of the rheumatic symptoms and
the liability of the heart to be involved. I have already stated
that nine out of ten of all cases of heart disease in early life,
not due to original malformation, are of rheumatic origin, and
further that heart disease comes on in the course of four out
of five cases of rheumatic fever in the child, slight as well as
severe. It seldom occurs before the third or fourth day of the
illness, so that if parents take the alarm at the very outset,
it is usually though not invariably possible for the doctor by
judicious treatment to anticipate and to prevent its occurrence,
or at any rate greatly to control its progress.</p>

<p>Every threatening of rheumatism, therefore, is to be watched
with the most anxious care, since so serious a complication as
disease of the heart may accompany extremely slight general
symptoms. It is wise too, to place any child in whom general
feverish symptoms come on at once under medical observation,
for though it does not usually happen, yet it does sometimes
occur, that rheumatic inflammation attacks the heart before any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>other local signs of the malady have manifested themselves.
It is scarcely necessary to add that tenfold precautions are
needed when rheumatism has once occurred, since the liability
to its return is very great, and the heart which escaped in the
first attack may suffer in the second; or the comparatively small
mischief done the first time may become an incurable disorder.</p>

<p><b>Ague.</b>&mdash;<i>Intermittent fever</i> or <i>ague</i> is very rare in childhood
in London; or at any rate it is very rare among children of
the wealthier classes. I believe it is everywhere rarer among
children than among grown persons, probably because they are
as a rule less exposed to those malarious influences which produce
it. In the child it generally takes the form of tertian ague,
that is to say the attack recurs every second day; one day of
freedom intervening between two attacks.</p>

<p>The three stages of shivering, heat, and sweating are less
marked in the child than in the grown person, and this indistinctness
of its symptoms is greater in proportion to the tenderer
age of the child. Shivering is scarcely ever well-marked, a
condition of unaccountable depression usually taking its place,
while once or twice I have known convulsions occur which
gave rise to the apprehension that disease of the brain existed.
The hot stage is long, and passes off gradually without the
profuse perspiration that occurs in the grown person, and the
child even between the attacks is almost always more or less
ailing.</p>

<p>A first and even a second attack may puzzle not the parents
only, but also the doctor; but after the symptoms have
returned a few times, the child being neither better nor worse
in the intervals, it becomes evident that no serious disease is
impending. The risk of an overhasty conclusion is that the
depression and disturbance of the nervous system may be
supposed to imply the existence of brain disease; and lead to
unsuitable treatment, instead of the administration of quinine,
which nine times out of ten proves a specific for ague. The
rapid increase of temperature in the attack, and its equally
rapid subsidence afterwards, will, if carefully noted, preserve
from error.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>There is much that is obscure with reference to the nature
both of rheumatic and intermittent fever. They differ from
other fevers not only by being neither contagious nor infectious
but also by their readiness to return, while a single attack of
any of the others furnishes a guarantee, and often a complete
guarantee, against its recurrence. In addition to these peculiarities,
the fevers of which I have now to speak are characterised
by running a certain definite course, being accompanied
by certain peculiar appearances on the surface (generally rashes
on the skin, whence their name of eruptive fevers); being
attended each with its own peculiar dangers, and all having a
tendency to what is termed epidemic prevalence; that is to say
to occur one year, and without obvious cause with vastly greater
frequency than in other years.</p>

<p><b>Mumps.</b>&mdash;It has been questioned whether that painful
but not dangerous ailment the <i>mumps</i>, ought or ought not to
be classed with these fevers. I think it should, for it is contagious,
infectious, runs a fairly definite course, is attended
with invariable external appearances, often prevails epidemically,
and one attack preserves in most instances from a second.</p>

<p>It very seldom befalls children under seven years of age,
and is more frequent in early youth than in childhood. It sets
in with the ordinary symptoms of a cold, which are followed
in about twenty-four hours by stiffness of the neck, and pain
about the lower jaw, which is increased by speaking or swallowing.
At the same time a swelling appears, sometimes on one
side sometimes on both of the lower jaw, and increases very
rapidly so as to occasion great disfigurement of the face. The
swelling goes on to increase, and to become more tense, attended
with more head-ache, fever, and discomfort for some forty-eight
hours, but then it begins to lessen, and the general illness subsides
rapidly, though the enlarged gland, for that is the cause
of the swelling, sometimes does not return to its natural size
for a week, ten days, or more; and now and then, though very
rarely, an abscess forms, which is both tedious and troublesome.</p>

<p>The treatment suitable for a severe common cold, together
with the constant application of a warm poultice to the swollen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>gland, is all that is usually required, though the doctor's help is
often needed to relieve the suffering which for the first day or
two in many instances attends the ailment.</p>

<p><b>Typhoid Fever.</b>&mdash;There is no question as to the place
which should be occupied by typhoid fever, smallpox, measles,
and scarlatina, for all belong to the class of eruptive fevers.
They are all specific diseases, each due to its own peculiar
poison, and not capable of being produced by any mere unsanitary
conditions, though such may aggravate their severity
and facilitate their spread.</p>

<p>The belief in the special character of each of these diseases
has received strong confirmation from the researches of the
eminent Frenchman, M. Pasteur, and others who have followed
in his track. They have discovered in the blood and other
secretions, and in some of the tissues both of men and animals,
minute microscopic organisms which differ in their characters
in different diseases. Experiment has further shown that in
some mysterious way these organisms are the cause of these
diseases, for on inoculating animals with them the peculiar
disease of which each was the accompaniment, and no other,
was reproduced in the inoculated animal.</p>

<p>As far as our knowledge goes at present then, we are forced
to regard each of these as a separate disease, measles never
passing into scarlatina, nor that into smallpox, but each, whether
slight or severe, retaining throughout its distinct character.</p>

<p>We have already seen how, in the course of various diseases,
the pulse is quickened, and the temperature raised, constituting
that state which we commonly call fever, but as the local
ailment subsides the fever disappears. There is, apart from
smallpox, measles, and the other so-called eruptive fevers, only
one real essential fever commonly met with in childhood, and
that is what the doctors call <i>typhoid fever</i>. The name, from
the similarity of sound to <i>typhus</i>, from which, however, it is
essentially different, has long been a name of terror in the
nursery, and all sorts of epithets have been substituted for it, as
gastric fever, and infantile remittent fever, and so on. Name
it as you may, the fever is one and the same with the typhoid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>fever, which one hears of as prevailing constantly in many continental
cities, and proving dangerous and fatal in any district
almost in direct relation to the neglect of drainage and
of proper sanitary precautions.</p>

<p>It is extremely rare in infancy, though I saw it once in a
babe eight months old, and is comparatively seldom met with
before the age of five years. From five to ten years old it is
more frequent than from ten to fifteen, but it is consolatory
to know that it is less fatal in early childhood than at any
subsequent time of life, and that cases of such exceedingly
mild character that the child's condition can be more
properly described as ailing rather than ill, are then far
from uncommon. The symptoms, however, are in all instances
similar in kind, though widely varying in degree,
and the duration of the fever is, as nearly as may be, three
weeks. By this it is not meant that at three weeks' end the
child who has had typhoid fever is well again, but only that
the temperature, which had hitherto been high, and always
higher at night than in the morning, has subsided, that the
skin has become less dry, the tongue slightly moist, the
intelligence more clear, that the fever has run its course. For
the first week or ten days, the symptoms have probably become
every day more grave; and for the next ten the doctor
could find no better consolation than the assurance&mdash;happy if
he could give it&mdash;that the condition was not worse, but that
you must have patience, for the time for improvement had not
yet arrived. If the attack has been severe, the child will be
left greatly exhausted, sadly emaciated, and suffering from the
effects of that ulceration of the bowels which accompanies
the fever, and from which life may still be in imminent danger.
But the fire is quenched; the question is no longer how to
put out the conflagration, but how to repair the mischief it has
caused.</p>

<p>When mild, the disease usually comes on very gradually,
the child loses its cheerfulness, the appearance of health leaves
it, the appetite fails, and the thirst becomes troublesome; in the
daytime it is listless and fretful, and drowsy towards evening,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>but the nights are often restless, and the slumber broken and
unrefreshing. The skin is hotter, and almost always drier than
natural, or if there is any perspiration, it comes on at irregular
times, lasts but an hour or two and brings no refreshing. The
thermometer will quite, in the early days, solve all doubt as to
the nature of the case. In the morning the thermometer will be
natural, or nearly so, but at seven o'clock in the evening it will
have risen to 101&deg; or 102&deg;, and will continue so during the early
part of the unquiet night. After midnight it will begin to fall, and
by six o'clock in the morning, or even earlier, will have regained
its natural standard. There is no other disease but typhoid
fever, and now and then some forms of galloping consumption,
in which these oscillations of temperature take place regularly.
Other symptoms attend typhoid fever besides these, and serve
to stamp upon it its distinctive character. The bowels are
usually loose, or if not, a moderate aperient acts on them excessively,
the evacuations being loose, often watery, of a light
yellow-ochrey colour. The abdomen is full, the bowels being
more or less distended with wind, sometimes tender, especially
at the right side, and both tender and painful in all cases
where the disease is severe. Towards the end of the first, or
at the latest by the middle of the second week, small rose-red
spots or pimples appear on the abdomen, sometimes also on
the chest and back. They disappear for the moment if pressure
is made on them, but reappear the moment the pressure
is withdrawn. Now and then they are numerous, and sometimes
two or three successive crops appear, the old ones fading
as the others show themselves; but in childhood they are often
scanty, though whether few or many, they are the external
characteristic of the disease just as the rash is in scarlatina or
measles.</p>

<p>Whenever a child of whatever age begins without obvious
cause to lose appetite and health, to become feverish, with
marked increase of temperature towards evening for several
days together, and more or less disposition to diarrh&oelig;a, it is
all but absolutely certain that the child has contracted typhoid
fever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>When the disease comes on gradually, it seldom becomes
dangerous, though until the end of the first week there is always
considerable uncertainty on this point. The amount of diarrh&oelig;a
and the degree of disorder of the brain, as shown by
restlessness, delirium, and stupor are the measure of the gravity
of any case. There is, however, scarcely any disease from
which even when most severe recovery so often takes place in
childhood, and this not as persons so often imagine from some
critical occurrence but by a process of gradual amendment.
The first signs of amendment, too, may be taken as giving
almost certain promise of complete recovery; but it is well to
bear in mind that there is no disease of early life in which the
mental faculties, though time brings them back at length uninjured,
remain so long in a state of feebleness and torpor as
in typhoid fever. Though the first signs of improvement, too,
are very seldom deceptive, yet the patient's convalescence is
almost always slow, and interrupted by many fluctuations.</p>

<p>Though contagious, still typhoid fever is far less directly
contagious than measles or scarlatina. It seems as if with this
disease, just as with cholera, the contagious element were present
in its most active form in the discharges from the bowels.
These should therefore be disinfected by carbolic acid or some
other disinfectant immediately; and should never be emptied
in a closet used by other members of the family, and more
particularly by children. Special precautions also should be
taken with the bed-linen, and night-dresses of the patient; and
it must be remembered that wise precautions have nothing in
common with exaggerated alarm. One more hint will not be
out of place. In typhoid fever, and still more in the highly
contagious measles and scarlatina, the person who sleeps in
the patient's room is much more likely to contract the disease
than she who sits up and watches at night keeping wide awake.
Whoever takes charge of a fever patient during the night
should therefore sit up and watch, not lie down and doze, and
this not for the patient's sake only, but for her own.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be necessary to say that in every, even the
mildest, attack of typhoid fever the attendance of the doctor is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>needed from first to last. He may come every day, and may
daily do nothing but merely watch. The disease will run its
course, the greatest skill cannot cut it short, though now and
then instead of lasting for three or even four weeks it comes to
an end spontaneously in fourteen days. Skilled watching is
what the competent doctor gives. You would not despise or
underestimate the pilot's skill, who steered your barque through
a dangerous sea in smoothest water, because he knew each
hidden rock or unseen quicksand on which but for his guidance
you might have made shipwreck.</p>

<p><b>Small-pox.</b>&mdash;At the present day, thanks to vaccination,
and to re-vaccination, <i>small-pox</i> is rarely met with in the well-to-do
classes of society, though it is not yet a century ago since
it found its victims not only among the poor, but among the
highest in the land. It does, however, occur sometimes after
vaccination, and sometimes, though very rarely, an attack of
small-pox fails to furnish an absolute guarantee against the
occurrence of a second.</p>

<p>Small-pox, unmodified by previous vaccination, sets in in the
child with violent sickness; vomiting, sometimes recurring frequently
for forty-eight hours, with much depression, or even
stupor; in some instances even actual convulsions, and fever;
but neither with the sore-throat of scarlatina, nor with the sneezing,
cough, and running at the nose of measles. At the end of
from forty-eight to sixty hours, an eruption of pimples appears
on the face, forehead, forearms and wrists, whence it extends to
the body and the lower limbs. They are reddish in colour, rather
pointed in form, and at first scarcely raised above the surface;
so that the eruption looks at first like the very early eruption of
measles; though the tiny pimples felt as if beneath the skin
serve even then to distinguish the one disease from the other.
In another forty-eight hours the character of the pimples has
changed into that of little vesicles or pocks, depressed instead of
pointed at their centre, and containing a little watery milky fluid.
They next enlarge, and become once more prominent at their
centre as they fill more and more with fluid, which becomes
thicker, yellowish-white&mdash;looks like, and indeed is, matter. Four
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>or five days are occupied with this process; the matter in the
pocks then begins to dry, and scabs to form, which gradually
by the end of another week drop off, and leave the skin spotted
with red or even scarred if the pocks went deep enough to
destroy the skin, and to leave the indelible marks, the so-called
pitting of small-pox.</p>

<p>The danger of the disease is in childhood the nervous
disorder at the outset, and then the exhaustion produced by
the so-called maturation of the pocks when the thin watery
fluid changes to the thicker matter, and depresses the patient
in the same way as he would be depressed by an enormous
abscess.</p>

<p>The first outbreak of the eruption is followed always by a
most remarkable abatement in the disturbance of the constitution,
and for three or four days, even though the eruption is
abundant, the patient may seem so well that it is almost impossible
to realise the imminent peril to which he will be exposed
in a few days' time.</p>

<p><b>Inoculation and Vaccination.</b>&mdash;The danger of small-pox
is in direct proportion to the abundance of the eruption;
and the great advantage of inoculation for the small-pox consisted
in the much scantier eruption which followed it, as compared
with that which commonly took place in the natural
small-pox.</p>

<p>The same advantage in a greater degree is obtained by
vaccination, even in the exceptional instances in which it
fails to render the person altogether insusceptible to the
disease.</p>

<p>The great advantage which inoculation secured was counterbalanced
in great measure by the fact that it always maintained
small-pox rife throughout the whole country, and that
consequently all who either had neglected inoculation, or young
children on whom, on account of their tender age, it had not
yet been practised, were more than ever exposed to constant
risk of infection.</p>

<p>This very real danger led to the almost unanimous welcome
which the practice of vaccination received towards the end of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>the last century, since it was hoped that by it not only would
the risk attending small-pox be lessened, and the disease when
it did occur be even milder in character than inoculated small-pox,
but that small-pox itself would eventually be extirpated.</p>

<p>These anticipations have not hitherto been fully realised;
but the good effected by vaccination has been such as to
render it, in the opinion of nearly everyone qualified to form an
opinion on the subject, one of the greatest boons ever conferred
on the human race.</p>

<p>Small-pox, like other eruptive fevers, has the peculiarity of
occurring for the most part only once in a person's life. We
do not know in the least on what this protecting influence
depends. We know the fact, but are the less able to offer an
explanation, since there are other constitutional diseases, such
as gout and rheumatism, in which the local symptoms are
equally the outcome of previous constitutional disorder, where
exactly the opposite rule obtains, and in which their occurrence
does but increase the liability to their return.</p>

<p>The protective power is apparently possessed by the mild
form of the disease communicated by inoculation as much as
by the severer form of small-pox which is contracted by direct
contagion or infection. This knowledge has been applied in
the treatment of some of the diseases of animals, and it has
been found in the case of the so-called small-pox in sheep (a
disease which, however, is quite distinct from human small-pox)
that while one in two of the animals who contracted it in
the ordinary way died, death took place in only three per cent,
or not one in thirty, of those in whom it was produced by
inoculation; and the inoculated sheep were thereby safeguarded
from subsequent attacks as completely as the others.</p>

<p>This knowledge was more recently applied by the distinguished
Frenchman whom I have already mentioned,
M. Pasteur, in the case of a fatal pestilence among sheep in
many parts of France, known by the name of <i>charbon</i>. The
inoculated sheep died, however, in such large numbers,
though in a somewhat smaller proportion than those who had
been directly infected, that he found it necessary to weaken the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>matter which he employed by admixture with other innocuous
materials. This experiment, however, again yielded unsatisfactory
results; slight symptoms of the disease were produced,
but the protection thus afforded was inadequate and uncertain.
Some few resisted the disease, but others contracted it and
died. With that clear insight which constitutes genius, M.
Pasteur next tried the experiment of inoculating the sheep first
with a weak matter which produced but slight symptoms, but
at the same time enabled the animal to support a second inoculation
with a stronger matter; and this second inoculation
enabled them to bear, unharmed, subsequent exposure to the
disease. A grateful country has given a pension, and conferred
well-merited honours on the man who has preserved their flocks
from pestilence, but whom the silly sentimentality of the anti-vivisectionists
in England would have mulcted in a fine, and, if
possible, have sent to prison.</p>

<p>That weakening of the poisonous element which Pasteur
strove to attain by art, is already provided by nature in the
cow-pox. The cow-pox is nothing else than small-pox modified
in character, diminished in severity by passing through the
system of the animal; but giving, when introduced into the
system, a safeguard against natural small-pox at least as complete
as that furnished by the inoculated disease.</p>

<p>More than 70,000 children have come under my observation,
either in hospital or in private practice; and I need not
say that a physician having much consulting practice sees far
more than the average of unusual and severe cases. Twice,
and only twice, I have seen infants die from vaccination, and
in both instances death took place from erysipelas beginning at
the puncture. The one case I saw twice in consultation with
the family practitioner. The other which I watched throughout
was that of a little boy, the fifth child of a nobleman of
high rank, both his parents being perfectly healthy. He was
vaccinated by the family doctor in the country, direct from the
arm of another perfectly healthy infant, from whom ten other
infants were vaccinated immediately afterwards. The little
boy was seized with convulsions within twenty-four hours, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>almost at the same time erysipelas appeared on the punctured
arm. The erysipelas extended rapidly, convulsions returned
more than once, and on the fourth day from the vaccination
the child died. One of the other children vaccinated at the
same time died in the country in the same manner; all the
others passed through vaccination regularly, and without a
single bad symptom. I have no explanation to offer; this
case stands by itself just as do those of death from the sting of
a bee or death from cutting a corn.</p>

<p>That some people die of other diseases since the introduction
of vaccination, is undoubtedly true, for many of those who
would have died in early infancy of small-pox are cut off later
by measles or bronchitis, or die during teething; since it is
obvious that vaccination does not protect against any other
disease than small-pox.</p>

<p>That protection, indeed, is not absolute, nor was the protection
afforded by inoculation absolute; but small-pox after
vaccination, even when it does occur, is very rarely severe, and
still more seldom fatal.</p>

<p>There seems good reason for believing that the protecting
power of vaccination tends to diminish with the lapse of time;
though apparently this is not always the case, nor can any
direct statement be made as to the conditions which favour this
in one case, or prevent it in another. As a matter of fact,
however, we do know that such a tendency does exist, and that
this tendency calls for the repetition of vaccination from time
to time; such re-vaccination carefully performed being as
nearly as possible an absolute guarantee against small-pox. All
persons engaged as nurses or attendants at the Small-Pox
Hospital during the past thirty-two years, have been vaccinated
or re-vaccinated before entering on their duties, and during
this period not a single case of the disease has occurred among
the whole staff. The experience of other small-pox hospitals
for a shorter period is identical. As far as we know, every
seventh year is a reasonable interval at which re-vaccination
should be performed.</p>

<p>One great cause of the failure of the protective power of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>vaccination is the unintelligent and careless manner in which
it is too often performed, especially among the poor. To this
same cause it is also due that in some cases of almost infinite
rarity one special constitutional disease has been known to be
communicated. I have never seen such a case, but I know
there are such. They are, however, no more a reason against
vaccination than the occasional death from an overdose of
opium is a reason against the use of that drug.</p>

<p>To avoid any risk of this kind, and also with the idea that
the power of the vaccine matter may have become weakened
by transmission through many thousands of persons, vaccination
direct from the calf has been introduced of late
years, especially in America and on the Continent. The time,
however, that has as yet elapsed is scarcely sufficient to test
the comparative preservative power of this as compared with
vaccination from the human subject. Its immediate local
effects are somewhat more severe; I do not know any reason
why its influence should not be equally abiding.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no foundation for the idea that scrofula,
consumption, or any similar disease can be transmitted by
vaccination. In some infants, whose skin is very delicate, and
especially in those, some members of whose family have been
liable to eruptions on the skin, vaccination has seemed to act
as an irritant, and to give occasion to an eruption, or
aggravate an eruption already existing. Such cases, however,
are not frequent, and the eruption is not more troublesome
than those which often appear in teething children. The
occurrence of actual erysipelas around the puncture, while very
dangerous, is, as I have already stated, of excessive rarity.</p>

<p>A thoroughly dispassionate review of the whole subject
appears to me to warrant the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That vaccination, though not a perfect guarantee against
small-pox, diminishes immensely the risk of its occurrence;
and that by periodical revaccination, this guarantee is rendered
all but absolute.</p>

<p>2nd. That a very large proportion of the failures of vaccination
are due to its careless and imperfect performance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>3rd. That to such careless performance and to the introduction
of the blood and not of the vaccine matter alone, from
one child to another are due the extremely rare instances in
which one special disease has been transmitted by vaccination.</p>

<p>4th. That there is absolutely no evidence of the transmission
of scrofula, consumption, or any similar disease by
vaccination.</p>

<p>5th. That vaccination direct from the calf appears to present
some decided advantages; but it has not yet been practised
for a sufficient time to admit of a comparison between its
preservative power and that of vaccination from one child to
another.</p>

<p>6th. That in either case it is expedient that vaccination be
performed within the first three months after birth, so as to
avoid the irritation of teething which is unfavourable to successful
vaccination, and also because the disposition to those
skin diseases which vaccination tends to aggravate is never so
considerable before the age of three months as it becomes
subsequently.</p>

<p>Even when vaccination fails to protect against small-pox
it tends to produce a modified and so much milder form of the
disease, that while one patient died out of every two in the
Homerton Small Pox Hospital who had the disease naturally, the
deaths were only one in four of those who had been imperfectly
vaccinated, and one in forty-three of those whose arms bore
evidence of perfectly good and successful vaccination.</p>

<p>The influence of previous vaccination often scarcely shows
itself in the stage which precedes the appearance of the eruption
of small-pox, the fever being often just as intense, and the
general symptoms just as severe as in the unmodified disease.
The difference, however, becomes at once obvious with the
appearance of the rash. The pocks are always much fewer
than even in mild small-pox, sometimes even not more than
twenty. They never attain above half the size of the ordinary
small-pox pustules; they run their course and dry off in half
the time, and consequently the dangerous fever which accompanies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>their development in the natural disease is almost or
altogether absent in the vast majority of instances.</p>

<p>If vaccination did no more than this it would be hard to
overestimate its value, or to praise as it deserves the merit of
its discoverer.</p>

<p><b>Chicken-Pox</b> is an ailment of such slight importance that
it would scarcely call for notice if it were not that the resemblance
of the eruption to that of small-pox sometimes leads to
its being mistaken for that disease.</p>

<p>It is highly contagious, and for this reason perhaps it is
usually met with in infancy and early childhood. Sometimes,
though by no means constantly, the eruption is preceded for
twenty-four or thirty-six hours by slight feverishness; but
oftener the appearance of the rash is the first indication of anything
being the matter. It shows itself in the form of small
pimples, which in a few hours change into small circular pocks
containing a little slightly turbid fluid. They appear on the
forehead, face, and body, but very rarely on the limbs; they
enlarge for some two or at most three days, then shrivel
and dry up; and at the end of a week the crusts or scabs fall
off, scarcely ever causing any permanent pitting of the skin.
They are usually not above twenty or thirty in number, though
every now and then they are much more numerous without
any obvious reason. Their distinction from the small-pox
eruption consists not only in the smaller size of the pocks, and
in the entirely different course which they run, but also in the
fact that two or three successive crops of the eruption appear
in the course of five or six days, so that new ones, those at
maturity, and those on which the crusts have already formed,
or from which they have already fallen, may be seen on the
child at the same time. This is sufficient of itself to establish
the difference between the two diseases, and also to distinguish
between chicken-pox and the milder variety of small-pox which
is sometimes observed in children who have been already
vaccinated.</p>

<p><b>Measles</b> is a disease with which almost everyone is
familiar, and one which with proper care is not generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>attended with danger. Its great risks are twofold; first, that
of its being complicated with bronchitis, or inflammation of the
lungs during its progress, and next of its being followed by an
imperfect recovery, and by the awakening into activity any
tendency to scrofulous or consumptive disease. On these two
accounts the disease is not to be made light of, and special
watchfulness is to be exercised during the whole time of
convalescence. It is also unwise when one child in a family
is attacked by measles to expose the others, as is often done,
to its contagion, in order, as people say, 'to get it over;'
for its mildness in one case furnishes no guarantee of its mildness
in another, and the danger of the disease is almost in exact
proportion to the tender age of those who are attacked by it.</p>

<p>The early symptoms of measles are those of a bad feverish
cold; the eyes grow red, weak, and watery, and are unable to
bear the light, the child sneezes very frequently, sometimes
almost every five minutes, and is troubled by a constant short
dry cough. About the fourth day, a rash makes its appearance
on the face, forehead, and behind the ears, and in the course
of the next forty-eight hours travels downwards over the body
and limbs, and then in another forty-eight hours it fades in the
same way, being at its height on the body when it has already
begun to disappear from the face. It first shows itself in the
form of small red circular spots, not unlike fleabites, but very
slightly raised above the somewhat reddened skin, and looking
for a few hours not unlike the very early stages of small-pox,
before the eruption has lost the character of minute pimples.
On the face the spots sometimes run together, and then form
irregular blotches about a third of an inch long by half that
breadth; while elsewhere they present an irregular crescentic
arrangement. As the rash fades it puts on a dirty yellowish
red appearance; the surface of the skin often becomes slightly
scurfy, and it continues somewhat stained of a reddish hue for
some days after the eruption has disappeared.</p>

<p>The only other point on which it is necessary to dwell is
this, that the symptoms do not, as in small-pox, become less
severe immediately on the appearance of the eruption, but continue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>just as troublesome as before for twenty-four hours or
more, the voice being hoarse, the cough even more incessant,
and the throat often slightly sore and red. Soon, however,
improvement becomes apparent, the fever lessens, the cough
grows looser; and in less than a fortnight the patient is usually
convalescent.</p>

<p>The above is pretty nearly the ordinary course of measles,
for we do not meet with that extreme variation in its severity
which is observed in scarlatina, where one child will seem
scarcely to ail at all, while its brother or sister may be in a
state of extreme peril. It is not wise, however, to trust a case
even of apparently mild measles to domestic management, for
while the cough is troublesome in almost every case, the ear
of the experienced doctor is needed to ascertain whether it is
merely the cough of irritation which attends the measles, or the
graver cough due to bronchitis.</p>

<p>One other caution will not be out of place. The danger of
exposure to cold is very real, but that does not necessitate the
loading the child with excessive covering, or the abstaining
from washing its hands and face. The child should be kept
moderately cool; and sponging its hands and face frequently
with tepid water soothes it and relieves the painful irritation
and itching.</p>

<p><b>German Measles.</b>&mdash;There is a disorder which seems to
hold a middle place between measles and scarlatina, akin to
both, identical with neither, and furnishing no sort of protection
from their occurrence.</p>

<p>It is known in this country by the name of <i>German measles</i>,
or sometimes by its German name of <i>R&ouml;theln</i>; the first clear description
of its character having been given by German writers.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that a very slight resemblance of some of
its symptoms to those of scarlet fever has led to its being
sometimes mistaken for it, and as the ailment is almost always
very trivial, doctors anxious to avoid alarming their patients'
friends, too often allow the error to go unrectified, and the
disease to pass as one of mild scarlet fever.</p>

<p>The resemblance of German measles to scarlet fever is,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>however, extremely slight, and is almost entirely limited to the
existence of a slight sore-throat, unaccompanied with glandular
swelling. The rash in no respect resembles the uniform redness
of the scarlatinal eruption, and there is no peeling of the
skin, nor even any roughness of the surface left behind.</p>

<p>Slight feverishness sometimes precedes the appearance of
the rash for twenty-four hours; but the cough, and sneezing,
and running at the eyes and nose, which usher in measles are
entirely absent. The rash usually appears in the course of
twenty-four hours, is never postponed beyond the second day;
it begins, like that of measles, on the face, and, like it, travels
downwards, but always disappears on the third day, while that
of measles is not entirely gone before the eighth or ninth.
The rash itself also has a different character. It consists of
small, slightly elevated, round red spots which now and then
coalesce into small patches, but never have the somewhat
crescentic arrangement observed in the rash of measles. The
colour of the spots is somewhat darker than that of the eruption
of measles, while the <i>skin between them remains pale</i>, and does
not assume the flush of measles. As it disappears it simply
fades, and does not at all change its tint as that of measles
does, and it leaves the skin unroughened.</p>

<p>Now and then German measles are severe, and are
attended with a good deal of fever for a day or two, and even
with symptoms of bronchitis. These cases are, however, very
unusual, are seen only at times when the disease prevails
epidemically; and even then the symptoms of the affection are
sufficiently marked to preserve from error all but those who
wish to be deceived, and to flatter themselves that their child
is henceforth protected from scarlatina.</p>

<p><b>Scarlatina</b>, or <b>Scarlet Fever</b>, for the two names mean
the same thing, the former being only the Latin term, and
not implying any greater mildness of the disease, is one of the
most formidable ailments of childhood, and especially of early
childhood, since the highest mortality from it takes place
during the third year of life.</p>

<p>It is more dreaded in a household, and justly so, than any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>other disease of childhood, though, indeed, it is not limited in
its occurrence to early life, and instances are familiar to us
all in which the mother, devoting herself to the care of her
little ones, has herself fallen a victim to the poison.</p>

<p>I do not think it so directly contagious, from person to
person, as small-pox, chicken-pox, or measles, but its infection
appears to be specially abiding in its character, and to cling
longer to the clothes, the bedding, and even the room of a
scarlet fever patient, than that of the other eruptive fevers,
except perhaps small-pox.</p>

<p>It is an object of special dread also for two other reasons.
One of these reasons is the extreme and causeless variations
in its severity; so that I have known more than one or two
children in the same family to have it so slightly as scarcely to
be ill, two to have their lives placed in jeopardy, and two to
die. The other reason for special dread is that the mildness
of the disease at its outset affords but a slight guarantee against
the occurrence of serious complications in its course, and still
slighter against secondary diseases which may follow in its
train, and either destroy life directly, or leave behind some
irremediable mischief.</p>

<p>Scarlatina has been divided by medical men into three
classes, according to its different degrees of severity; the mild&mdash;that
accompanied with bad sore-throat&mdash;and the malignant
variety.</p>

<p>We have specially to do with the first of the three; for it is
in it only that there is danger of the disease being overlooked,
or mistaken.</p>

<p>The symptoms of scarlatina usually appear within three
days after exposure to its contagion, and there is very good
authority for believing that the interval never exceeds six days.
I should not, however, feel quite secure until after the lapse of
ten days, and during this time the child ought to be isolated
from his brothers and sisters. In the mildest form of the disease
the appearance of the rash upon the surface, usually with,
but sometimes even without slight sore-throat and feverishness,
may be the first indication of an affection which is sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>so deadly. In the majority of cases, however, it is ushered in
by vomiting once or oftener, accompanied by headache, heaviness,
of head, great heat of skin, and some measure of sore-throat.
The brain is easily disturbed in children, as has
already been said, and delirium at night during the first
twenty-four hours of an attack of scarlet fever need not excite
anxiety, for it then often passes away, and the disease runs
a perfectly favourable course. The continuance of delirium
later is an attendant only on the graver forms of scarlet fever.</p>

<p>The rash often makes its appearance within twenty-four
hours after the commencement of the illness, at latest in the
course of the second day. It usually shows itself first on the
neck, breast, and face, whence it extends in twenty-four hours
to the body and limbs, and is then not seldom specially vivid
on the inside of the thighs. Its colour is a very bright red,
due in part to a general flush of the skin, in part to the
presence of innumerable red dots or spots, which do not
communicate any sense of roughness to the hand, though now
and then extremely minute red pimples are interspersed. For
three days the rash usually continues to become of a deeper
colour, and more generally diffused over the whole surface;
it then slowly declines, but does not wholly disappear until the
seventh or eighth day of the disease. As the rash subsides the
skin is left rough, and by degrees scales off, often in large
flakes from the hands and feet, but elsewhere in a sort of
branny scales. Sometimes this process is over in five or six
days, while in other cases the skin peels and is reproduced
several times in succession, so that it is protracted for three or
four weeks or even longer. The degree of this peeling also
varies as well as its duration. It is usually most considerable
where the rash has been most abundant, while where the rash
has been scanty, it is sometimes scarcely apparent except at
the tips of the fingers and toes and just around the insertion of
the nails.</p>

<p>Besides the rash there are commonly other symptoms not
less characteristic of scarlatina, and among them the sore-throat
is one of the most invariable. Even in mild cases, it is very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>rarely absent, and if not present at the beginning, it comes on
on the second or third day. The palate and tonsils, in these
circumstances are red, and the latter are usually more or less
swollen, while swallowing is attended with pain, or at any rate
with discomfort. The redness of the palate, which extends
also to the back of the throat, is a finely spotted redness closely
resembling the rash on the surface. The tongue is coated with
a thick white or yellowish coating, through which project
numerous bright red points, papill&aelig; as they are called, and
this appearance of the tongue is as distinctive of scarlatina as
the rash itself. Later, as the rash begins to fade, the coating
separates from the tongue, which is left of a bright red colour,
looking raw and shining, with the little raised red points
projecting beyond its surface, and constituting what has been
called in medical language, the strawberry tongue.</p>

<p>When all these symptoms are present, no one can doubt
but that the case is one of scarlatina. But the decision is far
less easy in mild cases, for in them the rash is sometimes
extremely evanescent, the general disturbance of health very
slight, and the fever and accompanying rise of temperature
small. The risk in such circumstances of the disease being
altogether overlooked is even greater than that of its being
confounded with some other eruptive fever. The rash of
measles cannot be confounded with that of scarlatina, and the
distinctly spotty character of the rash of German measles ought,
apart even from other differences, to render mistake impossible.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best rule that can be laid down is that every
diffused red rash, not obviously formed by distinct spots, even
though it be not uniform but appears in patches on the neck,
breast, back, or inside of the thighs, and persists for more than
twelve hours, is scarlatinal. Further, that in any instance in
which even very slight feverishness, or very slight sore-throat,
have preceded or accompanied the rash, the nature of the ailment
is stamped beyond the possibility of doubt. Mistakes
are made from want of careful observation, much more than from
any insuperable difficulty in distinguishing one disease from the
other. When the least hesitation is felt as to the nature of any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>rash which may appear on a child, with, or without previous
illness, the question should be at once referred to a medical
man. People are too apt in these circumstances to wait for a
few days, and then to appeal to the doctor when all traces of
rash have disappeared, and when the grounds no longer exist
on which he could base a positive opinion.</p>

<p>I need not describe the symptoms of severe and dangerous
scarlatina, for long before symptoms become really formidable,
the patients will have been placed under medical care. It may
suffice to say that the danger is almost always in proportion to
the severity of the throat-affection and swelling of the glands,
and not at all in proportion to the abundance of the rash.
Though severe cases usually set in with severe symptoms, yet
this is not invariably the case, and medical watching is all the
more necessary from the very commencement, since until the
end of the first week it is impossible to calculate on the subsequent
course of the disease. In malignant scarlatina happily
of infrequent occurrence, the child is struck down, as though
its blood were poisoned, from the very first; and death takes
place often within forty-eight hours, the rash appearing just
sufficiently to stamp the nature of the pestilence which has
proved so deadly.</p>

<p>It may form a useful conclusion to all that has been said in
this little book about the diseases of children, if I endeavour
to point out in what consist the duties of parents in cases of
scarlatina, or of any disease which resembles it.</p>

<p>1. To watch carefully the commencement of every slight
feverish attack in which a diffused red rash appears, even
though this should be only in patches, and to bear in mind the
possibility of its being due to scarlatina.</p>

<p>2. To remove the child immediately from the others, so
long as there is any doubt concerning the nature of the case,
and to remove with him his bed, bedding, and all clothes worn
by him at the time when the illness began, or the rash appeared.</p>

<p>3. To place the child if possible in a room at the top of
the house, so that the other children may not pass by his door.</p>

<p>4. Inasmuch as scarlatina often proves fatal to grown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>persons who have not already had the disease, to obtain at once
the attendance of a skilled nurse, in order to avoid the risk of
the disease spreading through the household.</p>

<p>The wife belongs to her husband, the husband to his wife;
their mutual duties are paramount over even those of the
parent; and neither has the right to jeopardise that life which
belongs to the other. To say, 'I shall not catch the disease,
because I have no fear,' is as idle as it would be for the soldier
to say, 'Because I am brave, therefore I am invulnerable.'</p>

<p>I have been accustomed to insist on the absence from the
room of father or mother, supposing either of them not to have
had scarlatina, so long as I could give the assurance that every
thing was going on well; but on the slightest anxiety I have
referred to both parents for their mutual decision as to the
course which they would choose to adopt.</p>

<p>From a refusal to be guided by this counsel, it has more
than once happened to me, to see the child recover from mild
scarlatina without a bad symptom, and the mother who had insisted
on nursing the little one die of the disease to which she
had needlessly exposed herself.</p>

<p>5. So soon as the disease has declared itself as scarlatina,
to take up the carpets and remove the curtains from the sick
child's room, to empty the drawers of any clothes which may
be in them, and to hang up outside the door a sheet moistened
with a solution of carbolic acid.</p>

<p>6. To arrange for all food and necessaries to be placed in
an adjoining room, or at the head of the stairs, so that there
may be no direct communication between the attendants on the
sick and the other inmates of the house.</p>

<p>7. To insist on the attendants not wearing either silk or
stuff dresses, but dresses of some washable material; and on
their changing their garments as well as scrupulously washing
themselves before mixing with other inmates of the house, and
especially with the children.</p>

<p>8. While in all respects obeying the directions of the
doctor, to grease the child all over twice in twenty-four hours
with suet or lard, to which a small quantity of carbolic acid has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>been added. This proceeding both lessens the amount of
peeling of the skin in a later stage of the disease; lessens the
contagiousness of the scales which are detached; and, by promoting
the healthy action of the skin, diminishes the risk of
subsequent disorder of the kidneys and consequent dropsy.</p>

<p>9. Even when the case has been of the slightest possible
kind, to keep the child always in bed for one-and-twenty days.
This was a standing rule at the Children's Hospital, and I am
certain that its non-observance will be followed three times out
of four by dropsy and kidney-disease.</p>

<p>10. When the disease is over, to destroy, if the parents'
means at all permit it, the clothes and bedding of the child.
When this is not practicable, to have everything exposed to
the heat of superheated steam in a Washington Lyons or other
similar disinfector, and to have all linen boiled as well as
washed. Lastly, to have the ceiling whitewashed, the paint
cleaned, the paper stripped, and the room repapered, as well
as the floor washed and rewashed with strong carbolic soap.</p>

<p>These precautions are troublesome and costly, but disease
is costlier still; and who shall estimate the cost of death!</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3><i>ON THE MENTAL AND MORAL FACULTIES IN
CHILDHOOD, AND ON THE DISORDERS TO
WHICH THEY ARE LIABLE.</i></h3>


<p>Any remarks on the ailments of children would be incomplete
if no notice were taken of the mental and moral peculiarities
of early life.</p>

<p>For want of giving heed to them, not only are grave mistakes
made in the education of children, but in the management
of their ailments, both by doctors and by parents: much
needless trouble is given to the doctors, much needless distress
to the child, much needless anxiety to the parents.</p>

<p>The common mistake committed by those parents who do
not make their child an idol to fall down and worship, and thus
turn him, to his own misery and theirs, into the most arbitrary
of domestic tyrants, is to treat him as though he were in mind,
as well as in body, a miniature man; feebler in intellect as he
is inferior in strength, but differing in degree only, not in kind.</p>

<p>Now the child differs essentially from the adult in the three
respects; that</p>

<p>1. He lives in the present, not in the future.</p>

<p>2. His perceptions are more vivid, and his sensibilities
more acute; while the world, on which he has just entered,
surrounds him with daily novelties.</p>

<p>3. He has less self-consciousness, less self-dependence, lives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>as a part of the world by which he is surrounded&mdash;a real
practical pantheist.</p>

<p>The child lives in the present, not in the future, nor much
even in the past, till the world has been some time with him,
and he by degrees shares the common heritage of retrospect
and anticipation. This is the great secret of the quiet happiness
which strikes almost all visitors to a children's hospital.</p>

<p>No one can have watched the sick bed of the child without
remarking the almost unvarying patience with which its
illness is borne, and the extremity of peril from which apparently,
in consequence of that patience, a complete recovery
takes place. Much, indeed, is no doubt due to the activity of
the reparative powers in early life, but much also to the unruffled
quiet of the mind. No sorrow for the past, no gloomy
foreboding of the future, no remorse, disappointment, nor
anxiety depresses the spirits and enfeebles the vital powers.
The prospect of death, even when its approach is realised&mdash;and
this is not so rare as some may imagine&mdash;brings in general
but small alarm. This may be from the vagueness of the
child's ideas; it may be, as the poet says, that in his short
life's journey, 'the heaven that lies about us in our infancy'
has been so much with him, that he recognises more clearly
than we can do</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">'The glories he hath known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that imperial palace whence he came.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I dwell on this truth, because it is of great practical
moment that we should bear in mind to how very large an
extent the child lives only in the present; because it follows
from it that to keep the sick child happy; to remove from it
all avoidable causes of alarm, of suffering, of discomfort; to
avoid, as far as may be, any direct struggle with its waywardness;
and even if death seems likely to occur, to look at it
from a child's point of view&mdash;not from that which our larger
understanding of good and evil suggests to our minds&mdash;are
duties of the gravest kind which weigh on the parent and the
nurse, no less than on the physician.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>But not only does the child live in the present far more
than it is possible for the adult, but there are, besides, other
important mental differences between the two. Not only is
the mind of the child feebler in all respects than that of the
adult, but, in proportion to the feebleness of his reasoning
power, there is an exaggerated activity of his perceptive faculties,
a vividness of his imagination. The child lives at first in
the external world, as if it were a part of himself, or he a part
of it, and the gladheartedness which it rejoices us to see is as
much a result of the vividness with which he realises the things
around him, as of that absence of care to which it is often
attributed. This peculiarity shows itself in the dreams of
childhood, which exceed in the distinctness of their images
those which come in later life. It shows itself, too, in the frequency
with which, even when awake, the active organs perceive
unreal sounds, or in the dark, at night, conjure up ocular
spectra; and then not merely colours, but distinct shapes,
which pass in long procession before the eyes. This power
fades away with advancing life; except under some conditions
of disease, the occasional appearance of luminous objects in
the dark is the only relic with most of us of the gift of seeing
visions with which, at least in some degree, we were endowed
in our early years. The child who dreads to be alone, and
asserts that he hears sounds, or perceives objects, is not
expressing merely a vague apprehension of some unknown
danger, but often asserts a literal truth. The sounds have
been heard; in the stillness of its nursery the little one has
listened to what seemed a voice calling it; or, in the dark,
phantasms have risen before its eyes, and the agony of terror
with which it calls for a light, or begs for its mother's presence,
betrays an impression far too real to be explained away, or to
be met by hard words or by unkind treatment.</p>

<p>Impressions such as these are not uncommon in childhood,
even during health. Disorder, direct or indirect, of the functions
of the brain, more commonly the latter, greatly exaggerates
them, and I have known them to outlast for many weeks all
other signs of failing health after convalescence from fevers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>The unreal sights are far more common than the sounds. The
sounds are usually of the simplest kind&mdash;as the tinkling of a bell,
of which we all remember the exquisite use made by Hans
Andersen in one of his nursery tales; or the child's own name,
at intervals repeated, just as the little watchful boy heard it in
far off Jud&aelig;a, when it was the prelude to a wondrous communication
from the unseen world. It came to him as he woke
from sleep, before the morning dawned, while the lamp, lighted
overnight, was burning still; and still it is so far the same that
these occurrences which suggest to us problems that we cannot
attempt to solve, mostly take place at times of transition from
the sleeping to the waking state.</p>

<p>The ocular spectra are usually far more vivid and detailed.
Those which occur in the waking state are by no means always
painful, though their strangeness not infrequently alarms the
child, and his horror at the dark arises, not from his seeing
nothing, but from his seeing too much.</p>

<p>Some imaginative children amuse themselves with these
phantasms, and then, if encouraged to relate them, will constantly
transgress the boundary line between truth and falsehood,
and weave their little romance. When they happen on
waking they are usually preceded by frightful dreams, but the
image which the child sees then is not the mere recollection
of the dream, but a new, distinct, though painful impression;
generally of some animal to which the child points, as now
here, now there. These night terrors from the very circumstantial
character of the impressions which attend them, often,
as I have already said, occasion needless anxiety as to the
importance of the cause on which they depend.</p>

<p>Sleep-walking in its smaller degrees of getting out of bed at
night, is by no means unusual in childhood; but the greater
degrees of somnambulism are certainly rare; and I have
always found them dependent on undue mental work; not
always, indeed, on the tasks being excessive, but sometimes on
the over-anxiety of the child to make progress. I have not
yet known a poor person's child a somnambulist.</p>

<p>But not only are the perceptions more acute in childhood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>than in adult life, the sensibilities are more intense. The
child's emotions, indeed, are often transitory&mdash;generally very
transitory; but while they last they produce results far greater
than in the grown person. In the case of the latter, recollection
of the past, anticipation of the future, or even the
duties of the present, control the overwhelming sorrow, or call
forth the energies needed to bear it. The child lives in the
present, and this present is but the reflection of the world
around, its impressions uncontrolled by experience, ungoverned
by reason.</p>

<p>The broken-heartedness of a child on leaving home is not
the expression only of intense affection for its friends or relations,
it is the shock of separation from the familiar objects
which have surrounded it; and I have not infrequently seen
children inconsolable when removed from homes that were
most wretched, or from relations who were most unkind.
Every now and then, indeed, I have been compelled to send
children home from the hospital because no love nor care could
reconcile them to the change from home; and they have refused
to eat, and spent their nights in weeping. The feeling
is an unreasoning one, like the home-sickness of the mountaineer.</p>

<p>But, moreover, sudden shocks may sometimes overthrow
the whole moral equilibrium, and disarrange the balance of
the nervous system so seriously as to cause the death of a child
previously free from any important ailment. Thus, I remember
a little boy five years of age who died sixteen days after his
father's funeral. The strange sad scene overcame him, though
there had been no special tie between him and his father. He
shivered violently, became very sick, complained by signs of
pain in the head, for he had lost his speech, which he regained
by slow degrees in the course of four or five days. Improvement
in other respects did not take place, he lay in a drowsy
state save when he called for his mother, and at length the
drowsiness deepened into stupor, and so he died. I suppose
his mother was right; she said his heart was broken.</p>

<p>It behoves us to bear in mind that the heart may break,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>or the reason fail, under causes that seem to us quite insufficient;
that the griefs of childhood may be, in proportion to the child's
powers of bearing them, as overwhelming as those which break
the strong man down. Every now and then we are shocked
by the tale that some young child has committed suicide, and
for reasons which to our judgment seem most trivial&mdash;from
fear of punishment, or even from mere dread of reproof.
These facts deserve special attention, they show how much
more the susceptibility and sensitiveness of children need to be
taken into consideration than is commonly done.</p>

<p>This keenness of the emotions in children displays itself
in other ways, and has constantly to be borne in mind in our
management of them. The child loves intensely, or dislikes
strongly; craves most earnestly for sympathy, clings most
tenaciously to the stronger, better, higher around it, or to what
it fancies so; or shrinks, in often causeless but unconquerable
dread, from things or persons that have made on it an unpleasant
impression. Reason as yet does not govern its
caprices, nor the more intelligent selfishness of later years
hinder their manifestation. The waywardness of the most
wilful child is determined by some cause near at hand; and
those who love children, and can read their thoughts, will not
in general be long in discovering their motives and seeing
through their conduct.</p>

<p>One word more must be said with reference to that intense
craving for sympathy so characteristic of the child. It is this
which often underlies the disposition to exaggerate its ailments,
or even to feign such as do not exist, and in such attempts at
deception it often perseveres with almost incredible resolution.
Over and over again I have met with instances where the
motives to such deception were neither the increase of comfort
nor the gratification of mere indolence; but the monopolising
the love and sympathy which during some bygone illness had
been extended to it, and which it could not bear to share again
with its brothers and sisters. This feeling, too, sometimes
becomes quite uncontrollable, and the child then needs as
much care and as judicious management, both bodily and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>mental, to bring it back to health, as would be called for in the
case of some adult hypochondriac or monomaniac.</p>

<p>A caution may not be out of place as to the importance of
not ministering to this tendency to exaggerated self-consciousness
by talking of children's ailments in their hearing, or by
seeming to notice the complaints they make as though they
were something out of the common way.</p>

<p>It will be observed that throughout I have dwelt more on
disorders of the moral faculties than of the intellectual powers
in childhood, and I have done so because I believe them to be
the more common and the more important. In the feeble-minded
the moral sense almost invariably participates in the
weakness of the intellect; but it is by no means unusual for
the former to be grievously perverted, while the intelligence is
in no respect deficient. The moral element in the child seems
to me to assert its superiority in this, that it is the most keenly
sensitive, the soonest disordered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune, and harsh,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the discord is first perceived in the finest notes.</p>

<p>To a very great extent, a mixture of vanity and of a morbid
craving for sympathy lie at the root of many of those perversions
of character which excite a parent's anxiety. One of
these consists in an over-scrupulousness with reference to the
right or wrong of actions in themselves quite indifferent; in
doubts as to whether the morning or evening prayer has been
properly said, whether something was or was not absolutely
true, whether this or that peccadillo was a grievous offence
against God, and so on; and all these little cases of conscience
are brought by the child several times a day to his mother or
to his nurse for solution. If listened to readily the child's
truthfulness becomes inevitably destroyed, and he grows up
with a morbid frame of mind, which after-life will aggravate
almost infinitely.</p>

<p>One knows indeed the history of child saints; but it must
be remembered that one great characteristic of pre-eminent
sanctity at all ages of life is reticence, while these little people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>are perpetually seeking to interest others in themselves, their
doubts, and feelings. If wisely dealt with, not by direct
ridicule, but by a wholesome neglect of the child's revelations,
treating them as of no special interest or importance, and discouraging
that minute introspection which, of doubtful good at
any age, is absolutely destructive of the simplicity of childhood,
this unnatural condition will soon pass away. It will help this
object very much, if the child is sent on a visit to judicious
friends, and change of scene, of pursuits, of playmates, and
amusements will be of all the more service since these morbid
states of mind seldom come on in children whose bodily health
is robust.</p>

<p>Another mode in which the same perverted feelings display
themselves is in the disposition occasionally noticed to exaggerate
some real ailment, or to complain of some ailment
which is altogether imaginary. So far is this from being rare
that my experience coincides entirely with that of the French
physician M. Roger, who has had larger opportunities than
anyone else in France for observing the diseases of children,
and who says, 'It must be borne in mind that simulated ailments
are much more common in the children's hospital than
in a hospital for adults.'</p>

<p>It is difficult to assign any sufficient reason for this conduct.
Mere indolence seems sometimes to be the chief reason for
it, oftener vanity; the sense of importance in finding everything
in the household arranged with exclusive reference to
itself appears to be the motive for it; and this may sometimes
be observed to be very powerful even at an exceedingly early
age. In many instances a morbid craving for sympathy is
mingled with the love of importance, and both these sentiments
are not infrequently exaggerated by the conduct of a foolishly
fond mother. Real illness, however, in almost all these cases
exists at the commencement, though the child persists in complaining
of its old symptoms long after their cause has disappeared.</p>

<p>The great difficulty which the doctor meets with in the
management of these cases arises from the incredulity with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>which his opinion is received. Candour is looked upon as so
eminently characteristic of childhood, that deceit seems impossible;
the case is thought by the parents to be an obscure
one which the doctor does not understand; and therefore it is
said, he, with want of straightforwardness and of kindness, throws
doubts on the existence of disease, and on the truthfulness of a
most loving, most suffering child. The vagaries of a hysterical
girl, the fits, the palsy, the half-unconsciousness have all been
assumed within my own observation by children from ten to
fifteen years old, and I have more than once had to give place
to the ignorant and impudent pretender who traded successfully
on the feelings of the parents. Sometimes, one knows
not why, except that the child has got tired of the part he was
playing, the symptoms that had caused so much anxiety suddenly
disappear, but even then the habit of mind left behind is
anything but healthy. Indeed in all cases of this kind it is
much less the state of the body than that of the mind which
excites my apprehension. The constant watching its own
sensations, the habit of constantly gratifying every wayward
wish and temper under the plea of illness, and the constant
indulgence which it too often meets with in this from the over-kindness
of its parents, exert a most injurious influence on its
character, and it grows up a juvenile hypochondriac.</p>

<p>A doctor is very unlikely to throw doubt recklessly on the
reality of a child's illness. His hesitation should certainly
not be attributed to unworthy motives; the parents should
co-operate with him heartily in any course of observation which
he desires to follow, and if necessary another medical man
of experience should be associated with the first, and allowed
to visit the child two or three times. One does not associate
the idea of moral delinquency with hysteria; the child who
shams belongs to the same class with the hysterical patient. It
is only the strangeness of the occurrence in the eyes of non-medical
people, that makes them fancy it something worse.</p>

<p>If now the suspicion is justified that the child is either
greatly exaggerating or altogether feigning illness, it does not
by any means always follow that he should at once be charged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>with it, since it is often of much importance that his self-respect
should not be destroyed. It must be remembered that there
is in all these cases a measure of real ailment underlying all the
half-unconscious exaggeration, and that if spoiling and over-indulgence
do much to foster it, sternness and punishment
interfere with recovery. To turn the thoughts away from self,
to occupy the mind with new scenes, new amusements, new
pursuits, to call forth by degrees self-control, and to let the
child perceive rather by your manner than by what is actually
said that the parents have not been duped by all his past
vagaries; such are the simple means by which the little one will
be brought round again to health of mind and health of body.
Unhappily, in the minds of too many people the idea of the
doctor is associated with the administration of drugs and with
nothing else; the treatment of disease is of much wider scope;
and many of our best remedies are those which do not admit
of being weighed or measured, and whose names are not inscribed
on the drawers or bottles in Apothecaries' Hall.</p>

<p>Another phase of mental disorder in childhood sometimes
presents itself as the result of overtasking the intellectual
powers. This over-work too is by no means due in all cases
to the parents' unwisely urging the child forward, but it is often
quite voluntary on his part. The precaution too of limiting the
hours of work is often inadequate from the want of some provision
for turning the thoughts and energies during play hours
into some perfectly different channel.</p>

<p>In many of these cases Nature happily takes matters into
her own management. For a year or two, or more, the mind
has grown apparently at the expense of the body; the parents
take a fearful joy in their darling's acquirements; and if it
should live, think they, of what remarkable talents will it not
be the possessor! By degrees, the extreme quickness of
intellect becomes less remarkable; but the body begins to
increase in robustness; and a year will sometimes suffice to
transmute the little fairy, so quick, so clever, but so fragile, into
a very commonplace, merry, rosy, romping child. I may add
that it is well to bear in mind the converse of this; to remember
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>that body and mind rarely grow in equal proportion at
one time; that the incorrigible little dunce, though not likely
to prove a genius as he grows older, will yet very probably be
found at twelve or fourteen to know as much as his playmates.
A dull mind, and a sickly or ill-developed frame may make us
anxious: but if the physical development is good, the mind
will not be likely to remain long below the average standard.</p>

<p>But sometimes, the over-tasked mind leads to mischief
which Nature cannot rectify; an attack of water on the brain
destroys the child, or if not it sinks under almost any accidental
disease. In other instances neither of these results takes place,
but the whole nervous system seems profoundly shaken, and
the moral character of the child seriously, and even permanently
injured. I remember a quick and clever little girl aged five and a
half years who was urged on by her governess to work which she
delighted in, till at length the signs of over-taxed brain showed
themselves in frequent extreme irritability, and occasional
attacks of causeless fury amounting almost to madness. It
was fully a year during which almost all mental work was suspended,
while the child was sent to have complete change
under most judicious management in the country, before her
mind quite recovered its balance and she became able to
resume her studies in a very moderate degree.</p>

<p>Cases such as this are instances of the slightest degree of
a condition which if not remedied may pass into confirmed
insanity. I believe the gradations to be almost imperceptible
by which the one state passes into the other; and I have
known instances in which the ungovernable temper and
occasional fury of the child have passed in youth into abiding
insanity which rendered the patient the inmate, and I fear the
permanent inmate, of a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>In whatever circumstances insanity comes on in childhood,
and it does sometimes, though very seldom, come on independently
of any obvious exciting cause, it always assumes the
character of what has been termed moral insanity, or of that
condition in which the moral system rather than the mental
power is chiefly disordered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>Idiocy is unquestionably of much more frequent occurrence
in childhood, than any of those forms of mental or moral
disorder of which I have been speaking hitherto. The term
idiocy, however, is a very wide one, including conditions differing
remarkably from each other both in kind and degree,
while not seldom it is misapplied to cases in which there is
mere backwardness of intellectual power.</p>

<p><b>Backward Children.</b>&mdash;<i>Enfants arri&eacute;r&eacute;s</i>&mdash;as the French
call them&mdash;constitute a class by no means seldom met with.
They generally attain their bodily development slowly, and the
development of their mind is equally tardy. They cut their
teeth late, walk late, talk late, are slow in learning to wash and
dress themselves, are generally dull in their perceptions, and do
not lay aside the habits of infancy till far advanced in childhood.
When the time comes for positive instruction, their slowness
almost wears out everyone's patience; and among the poor
indeed the attempt at teaching such children is at length given
up in despair, and growing up in absolute ignorance, it is
no wonder that they should be regarded as idiots. Still, dull
as such children are, there is between them and the idiot an
essential difference. The backward child, unlike the idiot,
does not remain stationary; his development goes on, but more
slowly than that of other children, he is behind them in the
whole course of their progress, and his delay increasing every
day, places at length an enormous distance between him and
them&mdash;a distance which in fact becomes insurmountable.</p>

<p>In some of its minor degrees even, this backwardness
not infrequently excites the solicitude of parents. It is sometimes
observed in children who had been ill-nourished in infancy or
who had been weakened by some serious or protracted illness,
even though unattended by any special affection of the brain;
but it is also met with independent of any special cause. The
distinction, however, between such a case and one of idiocy is
this, that though at four years old the child may not seem to
be intellectually superior to most children at two, yet in manners,
habits, and intelligence it does agree with what might be
expected from the child at two; less bright perhaps, less joyous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>but still presenting nothing which if it were but younger would
awaken apprehension.</p>

<p>It is well in all cases of unusual backwardness to ascertain
the condition of the sense of hearing, and of the power of
speech, for I have known the existence of deafness long overlooked,
and the child's dulness and inability to speak referred
to intellectual deficiency; and have also observed mere difficulty
of articulation, dependent partly on malformation of the
mouth, lead to a similar misapprehension. In both instances
I have seen this inability to keep up ready intercourse with
other children cast a shadow over the mind, and the little
ones in consequence be dull, suspicious, unchild-like. I have
already referred to a similar result as sometimes following
serious illnesses. The child will for months cease to walk, or
forget to talk, if these had been but comparatively recent
acquirements; or will continue dull and unequal to any mental
effort for weeks or months together, and then the mind will
begin to develop itself once more, though slowly, possibly so
slowly as never altogether to make up for lost ground.</p>

<p><b>Idiocy.</b>&mdash;In <i>idiocy</i>, however, there is much more than the
mere arrest of the intellect at any period. The idiot of eight
years old does not correspond in his mental development to the
child at six, or four, or two; his mind is not only dwarfed but
deformed; while feebleness of will is often as remarkable as
mere deficiency of power of apprehension. Even in earliest
infancy there is usually a something in the child idiotic from
birth which marks him as different from babies of his own age.
He is unable to support his head, which rolls about from side
to side, almost without an effort on his part to prevent it.
Next it is perceived that the child, though he can see, does not
notice; that his eye does not meet his mother's with the fond
look of recognition, accompanied with the dimpling smile, with
which the infant, even of three months old, greets his mother.
Then it is found to have no notion of grasping anything, though
that is usually almost the first accomplishment of babyhood;
if tossed in its nurse's arms there seems to be no spring in its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>limbs; and though a strange vacant smile sometimes passes
over its face, yet the merry ringing laugh of infancy or joyous
chuckle of irrepressible glee is not heard. As time passes
on, the child shows no pleasure at being put down 'to feel its
feet,' as nurses term it; if laid on the floor it probably cries,
but does not attempt to turn round, nor try to crawl about as
other babies do. It does not learn to stand or walk till late,
and then stands awkwardly, walks with difficulty, crossing
its legs immediately on assuming the erect posture, an infirmity
which it often takes years to overcome. Just, too, as the idiot
is slow to notice, slow in learning to grasp anything, or to
stand or walk, so he is late in learning to talk, he often acquires
but few words, for his ideas are few. He learns even these few
with difficulty, and employs the same to express many different
things; he generally articulates them indistinctly, often indeed
so imperfectly as to be almost unintelligible.</p>

<p>In other instances the evidences of idiocy are not present at
birth, or at any rate are not then noticed, but succeed to some
attack of convulsions or to some illness attended with serious
affection of the brain. Sometimes too there is no point in the
child's history which can be laid hold on as marking the commencement
of the weakening of his intellect, but as the body
grows the mind remains stationary, or its powers retrocede,
until by degrees the painful conviction that the child has
become idiotic forces itself upon the unwilling parents. Here
we have sometimes the sad spectacle of the body perfectly
developed, hale and strong, but the mind obscured; the child
in constant unrest, perpetually chattering, laughing without
cause, destroying its clothes, or the furniture of its room, for
no purpose; or sitting silent, with a weird smile upon its face,
looking at its spread-out fingers, or stroking a piece of cloth
for a quarter of an hour together as though the sensation
yielded it a kind of pleasure. It would be almost endless to
describe the various degrees of mental weakness; from the
slight silliness down to the condition in which the child is, and
remains all life long, below the level of the brute.</p>

<p>Parents as a rule are anxious to persuade themselves, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>to persuade the doctor that their idiot child was once as
bright and intelligent as others; and that the mind was darkened
by some grave illness. We have, however, the highest
authority, that of Dr. Down, for saying that as a rule which
has but few exceptions idiocy from birth is more amenable to
training than that which comes on afterwards, that in fact it is
more hopeful to have to do with an ill-developed than with a
damaged brain.</p>

<p>The one great question which still remains is what can the
parents do for best and wisest whom the affliction has befallen
of having an idiot child.</p>

<p>First. To moderate their expectations as to the results of
any, even the best devised and most successful treatment. The
child who has been born of weak intellect, or who has become
so as the result of illness, will always remain at a lower level
than others, and this, even though some one faculty, as the
musical faculty, or the power of calculation, should be above
the average.</p>

<p>Secondly. From the child's earliest infancy to occupy themselves
in perfecting as far as possible the physical powers and
aptitudes, and the habits of cleanliness and order. Development
of mind waits on development of body: to stand, to sit,
to walk, to grasp an object put into the hand, are essential to
bringing the idiot child into relation with the world around it;
are its elementary education, to be given patiently, cheerfully,
lovingly, even for years together. To attend to its natural
wants, and by fixed routine to accustom it at stated hours to
empty its bowels and its bladder is a lesson hard to teach; and
not less difficult is it to make the child learn to masticate its
food, to drink without slobbering, and then to use the spoon
and fork, and to feed itself; and afterwards to dress itself, to
wash itself, to tie its shoestrings; for idiots almost without
exception are awkward as well as lazy.</p>

<p>The common class of nurses, even the very kindest, find it
so much easier to feed the child, to wash it, and to dress it,
than to teach it to do any of these things for itself, that it too
often grows up, till too old to remain in the nursery, without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>having made the slightest advance above the condition of completest
babyhood. It is absolutely essential either that the
mother should devote herself solely to the care and teaching of
the idiot, or that she should engage a nurse who will have no
other duty. Such a person must be above the average in education
and intelligence, and of course will command more than
the ordinary wages. The mother, too, must resign herself to
the little one's affection being transferred in a great degree from
herself to the person who has constant charge of it&mdash;a hard
trial this, but one to which, for her child's good, she must bring
herself to submit.</p>

<p>Thirdly. So soon as the child has been taught at home to
exercise these lower powers, and the question of what is termed
its education arises, it is a matter of absolute necessity that he
be sent to an institution specially set apart for the feeble-minded.
It is absolutely impossible with the most devoted
love and the most lavish expenditure of money, to do at home
what can be, and is constantly, accomplished even in a pauper
idiot asylum. The imitative faculty, which is usually very
strongly marked in the idiot, furnishes one great means of his
improvement; while besides there are many of the moral
powers which cannot be brought out except in the society of
other children of his own age and not differing too widely from
him in mental power.</p>

<p>I have warned, and I repeat the warning, against exaggerated
expectations as to the results of even the wisest treatment. To
teach cleanliness, order, and neatness; to impart knowledge
enough to enable the idiot to take care of himself; to develop
his affections; to enable him to read and write; to practise
some easy handicraft; to partake of some simple pleasures,
and so at length to return to the shelter of his own home, and
to be there, not an object to be hidden away, too painful to
look upon, but an object rather of special tenderness, repaying
with his guileless love the sad self-sacrifice of his parents for
many a year; these are endeavours almost sure of accomplishment
in a well-conducted institution, sure never to be realised
in a home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>I have often sent afflicted parents, who shrank from parting
with their children, to one institution near London; and I
doubt not there are others in England, where pains, and care,
and skill, and untiring love awake the slumbering intellect,
arouse the dormant affections, and work miracles of healing
on these helpless little ones.</p>
